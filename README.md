Classify a researcher into multiple domains to get the knowledge of her/his research, using One-Class Classification technique. 
Various Machine Learning models were used for each classifier which used sparse matrices and dimensionality reduction, with capturing the semantic information, for determining a ranked list of probabilistic expertise for an input data.
Given a researcher, find the fields he has worked on across the past time and his interests, and the trend in the change of interests.
