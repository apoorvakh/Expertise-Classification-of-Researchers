Dynamic Backtracking,1993-08-01T00:00:00Z,M. L. Ginsberg,M. L. Ginsberg,cs.AI,"Because of their occasional need to return to shallow points in a search tree, existing backtracking methods can sometimes erase meaningful progress toward solving a search problem. In this paper, we present a method by which backtrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this difficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed backtracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful control information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by earlier approaches."
A Market-Oriented Programming Environment and its Application to   Distributed Multicommodity Flow Problems,1993-08-01T00:00:00Z,M. P. Wellman,M. P. Wellman,cs.AI,"Market price systems constitute a well-understood class of mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead. In a market-oriented programming approach to distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms."
An Empirical Analysis of Search in GSAT,1993-09-01T00:00:00Z,T. Walsh,"I. P. Gent, T. Walsh",cs.AI,"We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure for propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a more complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems, there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis. This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms."
The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut,1993-11-01T00:00:00Z,U. Trinchero,"F. Bergadano, D. Gunetti, U. Trinchero",cs.AI,"As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages."
Software Agents: Completing Patterns and Constructing User Interfaces,1993-11-01T00:00:00Z,L. A. Hermens,"J. C. Schlimmer, L. A. Hermens",cs.AI,"To support the goal of allowing users to record and retrieve information, this paper describes an interactive note-taking system for pen-based computers with two distinctive features. First, it actively predicts what the user is going to write. Second, it automatically constructs a custom, button-box user interface on request. The system is an example of a learning-apprentice software- agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and semantics of the user's information. A performance system uses this learned information to generate completion strings and construct a user interface. Description of Online Appendix: People like to record information. Doing this on paper is initially efficient, but lacks flexibility. Recording information on a computer is less efficient but more powerful. In our new note taking softwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the interface, an agent acts for the user. To help, it provides defaults and constructs a custom user interface. The demonstration is a QuickTime movie of the note taking agent in action. The file is a binhexed self-extracting archive. Macintosh utilities for binhex are available from mac.archive.umich.edu. QuickTime is available from ftp.apple.com in the dts/mac/sys.soft/quicktime."
Decidable Reasoning in Terminological Knowledge Representation Systems,1993-12-01T00:00:00Z,A. Schaerf,"M. Buchheit, F. M. Donini, A. Schaerf",cs.AI,"Terminological knowledge representation systems (TKRSs) are tools for designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages (or concept languages). We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new features studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological language, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge bases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems. As a byproduct of the proof, we get also the result that inclusion statements in ALCNR can be simulated by terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is adopted."
Teleo-Reactive Programs for Agent Control,1994-01-01T00:00:00Z,N. Nilsson,N. Nilsson,cs.AI,"A formalism is presented for computing and organizing actions for autonomous agents in dynamic environments. We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots."
Learning the Past Tense of English Verbs: The Symbolic Pattern   Associator vs. Connectionist Models,1994-02-01T00:00:00Z,C. X. Ling,C. X. Ling,cs.AI,"Learning the past tense of English verbs - a seemingly minor aspect of language acquisition - has generated heated debates since 1986, and has become a landmark task for testing the adequacy of cognitive modeling. Several artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been implemented, and a challenge for better symbolic models has been posed. In this paper, we present a general-purpose Symbolic Pattern Associator (SPA) based upon the decision-tree learning algorithm ID3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the generalization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different representations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes the past tense of unseen verbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why this should be the case. We also discuss a new default strategy for decision-tree learning algorithms."
Substructure Discovery Using Minimum Description Length and Background   Knowledge,1994-02-01T00:00:00Z,L. B. Holder,"D. J. Cook, L. B. Holder",cs.AI,"The ability to identify interesting and repetitive substructures is an essential component to discovering knowledge in structural data. We describe a new version of our SUBDUE substructure discovery system based on the minimum description length principle. The SUBDUE system discovers substructures that compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. By replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of SUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the data. SUBDUE uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identifies similar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and finds an approximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational constraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other background knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more appropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate SUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data and to discover structural concepts important to the domain. Description of Online Appendix: This is a compressed tar file containing the SUBDUE discovery system, written in C. The program accepts as input databases represented in graph form, and will output discovered substructures with their corresponding value."
Bias-Driven Revision of Logical Domain Theories,1994-02-01T00:00:00Z,A. M. Segre,"M. Koppel, R. Feldman, A. M. Segre",cs.AI,"The theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a deficient domain theory using information contained in examples that expose inaccuracies. In this paper we present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories. The approach described here, called PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically track the ``flow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories."
Exploring the Decision Forest: An Empirical Investigation of Occam's   Razor in Decision Tree Induction,1994-03-01T00:00:00Z,M. J. Pazzani,"P. M. Murphy, M. J. Pazzani",cs.AI,"We report on a series of experiments in which all decision trees consistent with the training data are constructed. These experiments were run to gain an understanding of the properties of the set of consistent decision trees and the factors that affect the accuracy of individual trees. In particular, we investigated the relationship between the size of a decision tree consistent with some training data and the accuracy of the tree on test data. The experiments were performed on a massively parallel Maspar computer. The results of the experiments on several artificial and two real world problems indicate that, for many of the problems investigated, smaller consistent decision trees are on average less accurate than the average accuracy of slightly larger trees."
A Semantics and Complete Algorithm for Subsumption in the CLASSIC   Description Logic,1994-06-01T00:00:00Z,P. F. Patel-Schneider,"A. Borgida, P. F. Patel-Schneider",cs.AI,"This paper analyzes the correctness of the subsumption algorithm used in CLASSIC, a description logic-based knowledge representation system that is being used in practical applications. In order to deal efficiently with individuals in CLASSIC descriptions, the developers have had to use an algorithm that is incomplete with respect to the standard, model-theoretic semantics for description logics. We provide a variant semantics for descriptions with respect to which the current implementation is complete, and which can be independently motivated. The soundness and completeness of the polynomial-time subsumption algorithm is established using description graphs, which are an abstracted version of the implementation structures used in CLASSIC, and are of independent interest."
Applying GSAT to Non-Clausal Formulas,1994-06-01T00:00:00Z,R. Sebastiani,R. Sebastiani,cs.AI,"In this paper we describe how to modify GSAT so that it can be applied to non-clausal formulas. The idea is to use a particular ``score'' function which gives the number of clauses of the CNF conversion of a formula which are false under a given truth assignment. Its value is computed in linear time, without constructing the CNF conversion itself. The proposed methodology applies to most of the variants of GSAT proposed so far."
Random Worlds and Maximum Entropy,1994-08-01T00:00:00Z,D. Koller,"A. J. Grove, J. Y. Halpern, D. Koller",cs.AI,"Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a degree of belief that some formula Phi holds given KB. If we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB, and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence, but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximum-entropy methods."
Pattern Matching and Discourse Processing in Information Extraction from   Japanese Text,1994-08-01T00:00:00Z,M. Hara,"T. Kitani, Y. Eriguchi, M. Hara",cs.AI,"Information extraction is the task of automatically picking up information of interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information. Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high level of system performance which approaches human performance."
A System for Induction of Oblique Decision Trees,1994-08-01T00:00:00Z,S. Salzberg,"S. K. Murthy, S. Kasif, S. Salzberg",cs.AI,"This article describes a new system for induction of oblique decision trees. This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees."
On Planning while Learning,1994-09-01T00:00:00Z,M. Tennenholtz,"S. Safra, M. Tennenholtz",cs.AI,"This paper introduces a framework for Planning while Learning where an agent is given a goal to achieve in an environment whose behavior is only partially known to the agent. We discuss the tractability of various plan-design processes. We show that for a large natural class of Planning while Learning systems, a plan can be presented and verified in a reasonable time. However, coming up algorithmically with a plan, even for simple classes of systems is apparently intractable. We emphasize the role of off-line plan-design processes, and show that, in most natural cases, the verification (projection) part can be carried out in an efficient algorithmic manner."
Wrap-Up: a Trainable Discourse Module for Information Extraction,1994-12-01T00:00:00Z,Lehnert. W,"S. Soderland, Lehnert. W",cs.AI,"The vast amounts of on-line text now available have led to renewed interest in information extraction (IE) systems that analyze unrestricted text, producing a structured representation of selected information from the text. This paper presents a novel approach that uses machine learning to acquire knowledge for some of the higher level IE processing. Wrap-Up is a trainable IE discourse component that makes intersentential inferences and identifies logical relations among information extracted from the text. Previous corpus-based approaches were limited to lower level processing such as part-of-speech tagging, lexical disambiguation, and dictionary construction. Wrap-Up is fully trainable, and not only automatically decides what classifiers are needed, but even derives the feature set for each classifier automatically. Performance equals that of a partially trainable discourse module requiring manual customization for each domain."
Operations for Learning with Graphical Models,1994-12-01T00:00:00Z,W. L. Buntine,W. L. Buntine,cs.AI,"This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms."
Total-Order and Partial-Order Planning: A Comparative Analysis,1994-12-01T00:00:00Z,M. Drummond,"S. Minton, J. Bresina, M. Drummond",cs.AI,"For many years, the intuitions underlying partial-order planning were largely taken for granted. Only in the past few years has there been renewed interest in the fundamental principles underlying this paradigm. In this paper, we present a rigorous comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order planning by focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For instance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon the search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the underlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners."
Solving Multiclass Learning Problems via Error-Correcting Output Codes,1995-01-01T00:00:00Z,G. Bakiri,"T. G. Dietterich, G. Bakiri",cs.AI,"Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt 2 values (i.e., k ``classes''). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems."
A Domain-Independent Algorithm for Plan Adaptation,1995-01-01T00:00:00Z,D. S. Weld,"S. Hanks, D. S. Weld",cs.AI,"The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan debugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or repairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound, complete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the literature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a library plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same refinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract constraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that the adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its systematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any parts of the graph."
Truncating Temporal Differences: On the Efficient Implementation of   TD(lambda) for Reinforcement Learning,1995-01-01T00:00:00Z,P. Cichosz,P. Cichosz,cs.AI,"Temporal difference (TD) methods constitute a class of methods for learning predictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency factor lambda. Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda &gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning."
Cost-Sensitive Classification: Empirical Evaluation of a Hybrid Genetic   Decision Tree Induction Algorithm,1995-03-01T00:00:00Z,P. D. Turney,P. D. Turney,cs.AI,"This paper introduces ICET, a new algorithm for cost-sensitive classification. ICET uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of biases for a decision tree induction algorithm. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is the average cost of classification when using the decision tree, including both the costs of tests (features, measurements) and the costs of classification errors. ICET is compared here with three other algorithms for cost-sensitive classification - EG2, CS-ID3, and IDX - and also with C4.5, which classifies without regard to cost. The five algorithms are evaluated empirically on five real-world medical datasets. Three sets of experiments are performed. The first set examines the baseline performance of the five algorithms on the five datasets and establishes that ICET performs significantly better than its competitors. The second set tests the robustness of ICET under a variety of conditions and shows that ICET maintains its advantage. The third set looks at ICET's search in bias space and discovers a way to improve the search."
Rerepresenting and Restructuring Domain Theories: A Constructive   Induction Approach,1995-04-01T00:00:00Z,L. A. Rendell,"S. K. Donoho, L. A. Rendell",cs.AI,"Theory revision integrates inductive learning and background knowledge by combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more accurate theory. There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior, limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction."
Using Pivot Consistency to Decompose and Solve Functional CSPs,1995-05-01T00:00:00Z,P. David,P. David,cs.AI,"Many studies have been carried out in order to increase the search efficiency of constraint satisfaction problems; among them, some make use of structural properties of the constraint network; others take into account semantic properties of the constraints, generally assuming that all the constraints possess the given property. In this paper, we propose a new decomposition method benefiting from both semantic properties of functional constraints (not bijective constraints) and structural properties of the network; furthermore, not all the constraints need to be functional. We show that under some conditions, the existence of solutions can be guaranteed. We first characterize a particular subset of the variables, which we name a root set. We then introduce pivot consistency, a new local consistency which is a weak form of path consistency and can be achieved in O(n^2d^2) complexity (instead of O(n^3d^3) for path consistency), and we present associated properties; in particular, we show that any consistent instantiation of the root set can be linearly extended to a solution, which leads to the presentation of the aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional CSPs."
Adaptive Load Balancing: A Study in Multi-Agent Learning,1995-05-01T00:00:00Z,M. Tennenholtz,"A. Schaerf, Y. Shoham, M. Tennenholtz",cs.AI,"We study the process of multi-agent reinforcement learning in the context of load balancing in a distributed system, without use of either central coordination or explicit communication. We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, important features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and address the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context. Finally, we show that naive use of communication may not improve, and might even harm system efficiency."
Provably Bounded-Optimal Agents,1995-05-01T00:00:00Z,D. Subramanian,"S. J. Russell, D. Subramanian",cs.AI,"Since its inception, artificial intelligence has relied upon a theoretical foundation centered around perfect rationality as the desired property of intelligent systems. We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and game theory."
Pac-Learning Recursive Logic Programs: Efficient Algorithms,1995-05-01T00:00:00Z,W. W. Cohen,W. W. Cohen,cs.AI,"We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive logic programs in polynomial time from equivalence queries. In particular, we show that a single k-ary recursive constant-depth determinate clause is learnable. Two-clause programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and one constant-depth determinate non-recursive clause are also learnable, if an additional ``basecase'' oracle is assumed. These results immediately imply the pac-learnability of these classes. Although these classes of learnable recursive programs are very constrained, it is shown in a companion paper that they are maximally general, in that generalizing either class in any natural way leads to a computationally difficult learning problem. Thus, taken together with its companion paper, this paper establishes a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive logic programs."
Pac-learning Recursive Logic Programs: Negative Results,1995-05-01T00:00:00Z,W. W. Cohen,W. W. Cohen,cs.AI,"In a companion paper it was shown that the class of constant-depth determinate k-ary recursive clauses is efficiently learnable. In this paper we present negative results showing that any natural generalization of this class is hard to learn in Valiant's model of pac-learnability. In particular, we show that the following program classes are cryptographically hard to learn: programs with an unbounded number of constant-depth linear recursive clauses; programs with one constant-depth determinate clause containing an unbounded number of recursive calls; and programs with one linear recursive clause of constant locality. These results immediately imply the non-learnability of any more general class of programs. We also show that learning a constant-depth determinate program with either two linear recursive clauses or one linear recursive clause and one non-recursive clause is as hard as learning boolean DNF. Together with positive results from the companion paper, these negative results establish a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive function-free clauses."
FLECS: Planning with a Flexible Commitment Strategy,1995-06-01T00:00:00Z,P. Stone,"M. Veloso, P. Stone",cs.AI,"There has been evidence that least-commitment planners can efficiently handle planning problems that involve difficult goal interactions. This evidence has led to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the ""best"" possible planning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment planners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in particular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of trying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which planning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm, FLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step orderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to eager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering commitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can vary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also during the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning. FLECS provides a framework to investigate the mapping from planning domains and problems to efficient planning strategies."
Induction of First-Order Decision Lists: Results on Learning the Past   Tense of English Verbs,1995-06-01T00:00:00Z,M. E. Califf,"R. J. Mooney, M. E. Califf",cs.AI,"This paper presents a method for inducing logic programs from examples that learns a new class of concepts called first-order decision lists, defined as ordered lists of clauses each ending in a cut. The method, called FOIDL, is based on FOIL (Quinlan, 1990) but employs intensional background knowledge and avoids the need for explicit negative examples. It is particularly useful for problems that involve rules with specific exceptions, such as learning the past-tense of English verbs, a task widely studied in the context of the symbolic/connectionist debate. FOIDL is able to learn concise, accurate programs for this problem from significantly fewer examples than previous methods (both connectionist and symbolic)."
Building and Refining Abstract Planning Cases by Change of   Representation Language,1995-07-01T00:00:00Z,W. Wilke,"R. Bergmann, W. Wilke",cs.AI,"ion is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of problem solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description -- as used in most hierarchical planners -- has proven useful. In this paper we present examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning."
Using Qualitative Hypotheses to Identify Inaccurate Data,1995-08-01T00:00:00Z,T. Nishida,"Q. Zhao, T. Nishida",cs.AI,"Identifying inaccurate data has long been regarded as a significant and difficult problem in AI. In this paper, we present a new method for identifying inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative correlations among related data. First, we introduce the definitions of related data and qualitative correlations among related data. Then we put forward a new concept called support coefficient function (SCF). SCF can be used to extract, represent, and calculate qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset. We propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of inaccurate data, and an approach to calculating possibility of identifying inaccurate data, respectively. Both of the approaches are based on SCF. Finally we present an algorithm for identifying inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations among related data as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence. We have developed a practical system for interpreting infrared spectra by applying the method, and have fully tested the system against several hundred real spectra. The experimental results show that the method is significantly better than the conventional methods used in many similar systems."
An Integrated Framework for Learning and Reasoning,1995-08-01T00:00:00Z,T. R. Martinez,"C. G. Giraud-Carrier, T. R. Martinez",cs.AI,"Learning and reasoning are both aspects of what is considered to be intelligence. Their studies within AI have been separated historically, learning being the topic of machine learning and neural networks, and reasoning falling under classical (or symbolic) AI. However, learning and reasoning are in many ways interdependent. This paper discusses the nature of some of these interdependencies and proposes a general framework called FLARE, that combines inductive learning using prior knowledge together with reasoning in a propositional setting. Several examples that test the framework are presented, including classical induction, many important reasoning protocols and two simple expert systems."
Diffusion of Context and Credit Information in Markovian Models,1995-10-01T00:00:00Z,P. Frasconi,"Y. Bengio, P. Frasconi",cs.AI,"This paper studies the problem of ergodicity of transition probability matrices in Markovian models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), and how it makes very difficult the task of learning to represent long-term context for sequential data. This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially deterministic. The results found in this paper apply to learning approaches based on continuous optimization, such as gradient descent and the Baum-Welch algorithm."
Improving Connectionist Energy Minimization,1995-10-01T00:00:00Z,R. Dechter,"G. Pinkas, R. Dechter",cs.AI,"Symmetric networks designed for energy minimization such as Boltzman machines and Hopfield nets are frequently investigated for use in optimization, constraint satisfaction and approximation of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless, finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate, is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system (self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step. In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be improved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called activate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance guarantees that are related to the size of the network's cycle-cutset."
Learning Membership Functions in a Function-Based Object Recognition   System,1995-10-01T00:00:00Z,L. Stark,"K. Woods, D. Cook, L. Hall, K. Bowyer, L. Stark",cs.AI,"Functionality-based recognition systems recognize objects at the category level by reasoning about how well the objects support the expected function. Such systems naturally associate a ``measure of goodness'' or ``membership value'' with a recognized object. This measure of goodness is the result of combining individual measures, or membership values, from potentially many primitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A membership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a primitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions of a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the primitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper, we provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that automatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects labeled with their desired category measure. The learning algorithm is generally applicable to any problem in which low-level membership values are combined through an and-or tree structure to give a final overall membership value."
Flexibly Instructable Agents,1995-11-01T00:00:00Z,J. E. Laird,"S. B. Huffman, J. E. Laird",cs.AI,"This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks."
OPUS: An Efficient Admissible Algorithm for Unordered Search,1995-12-01T00:00:00Z,G. I. Webb,G. I. Webb,cs.AI,"OPUS is a branch and bound search algorithm that enables efficient admissible search through spaces for which the order of search operator application is not significant. The algorithm's search efficiency is demonstrated with respect to very large machine learning search spaces. The use of admissible search is of potential value to the machine learning community as it means that the exact learning biases to be employed for complex learning tasks can be precisely specified and manipulated. OPUS also has potential for application in other areas of artificial intelligence, notably, truth maintenance."
Vision-Based Road Detection in Automotive Systems: A Real-Time   Expectation-Driven Approach,1995-12-01T00:00:00Z,S. Berte,"A. Broggi, S. Berte",cs.AI,"The main aim of this work is the development of a vision-based road detection system fast enough to cope with the difficult real-time constraints imposed by moving vehicle applications. The hardware platform, a special-purpose massively parallel system, has been chosen to minimize system production and operational costs. This paper presents a novel approach to expectation-driven low-level image segmentation, which can be mapped naturally onto mesh-connected massively parallel SIMD architectures capable of handling hierarchical data structures. The input image is assumed to contain a distorted version of a given template; a multiresolution stretching process is used to reshape the original template in accordance with the acquired image content, minimizing a potential function. The distorted template is the process output."
Generalization of Clauses under Implication,1995-12-01T00:00:00Z,P. Idestam-Almquist,P. Idestam-Almquist,cs.AI,"In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion."
Decision-Theoretic Foundations for Causal Reasoning,1995-12-01T00:00:00Z,R. Shachter,"D. Heckerman, R. Shachter",cs.AI,"We present a definition of cause and effect in terms of decision-theoretic primitives and thereby provide a principled foundation for causal reasoning. Our definition departs from the traditional view of causation in that causal assertions may vary with the set of decisions available. We argue that this approach provides added clarity to the notion of cause. Also in this paper, we examine the encoding of causal relationships in directed acyclic graphs. We describe a special class of influence diagrams, those in canonical form, and show its relationship to Pearl's representation of cause and effect. Finally, we show how canonical form facilitates counterfactual reasoning."
Translating between Horn Representations and their Characteristic Models,1995-12-01T00:00:00Z,R. Khardon,R. Khardon,cs.AI,"Characteristic models are an alternative, model based, representation for Horn expressions. It has been shown that these two representations are incomparable and each has its advantages over the other. It is therefore natural to ask what is the cost of translating, back and forth, between these representations. Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in database theory, where it has applications to the design of relational databases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems. Our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under polynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding decision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression. We also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well known problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no polynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a special case they are equivalent to it."
Statistical Feature Combination for the Evaluation of Game Positions,1995-12-01T00:00:00Z,M. Buro,M. Buro,cs.AI,"This article describes an application of three well-known statistical methods in the field of game-tree search: using a large number of classified Othello positions, feature weights for evaluation functions with a game-phase-independent meaning are estimated by means of logistic regression, Fisher's linear discriminant, and the quadratic discriminant function for normally distributed features. Thereafter, the playing strengths are compared by means of tournaments between the resulting versions of a world-class Othello program. In this application, logistic regression - which is used here for the first time in the context of game playing - leads to better results than the other approaches."
Rule-based Machine Learning Methods for Functional Prediction,1995-12-01T00:00:00Z,N. Indurkhya,"S. M. Weiss, N. Indurkhya",cs.AI,"We describe a machine learning method for predicting the value of a real-valued function, given the values of multiple input variables. The method induces solutions from samples in the form of ordered disjunctive normal form (DNF) decision rules. A central objective of the method and representation is the induction of compact, easily interpretable solutions. This rule-based decision model can be extended to search efficiently for similar cases prior to approximating function values. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with existing machine learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield superior regression performance."
The Design and Experimental Analysis of Algorithms for Temporal Reasoning,1996-01-01T00:00:00Z,D. W. Manchak,"P. vanBeek, D. W. Manchak",cs.AI,"Many applications -- from planning and scheduling to problems in molecular biology -- rely heavily on a temporal reasoning component. In this paper, we discuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal reasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for representing temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for determining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two important algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a backtracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop techniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly optimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable and value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically improve the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time and space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems that are of practical size."
Well-Founded Semantics for Extended Logic Programs with Dynamic   Preferences,1996-02-01T00:00:00Z,G. Brewka,G. Brewka,cs.AI,The paper describes an extension of well-founded semantics for logic programs with two types of negation. In this extension information about preferences between rules can be expressed in the logical language and derived dynamically. This is achieved by using a reserved predicate symbol and a naming technique. Conflicts among rules are resolved whenever possible on the basis of derived preference information. The well-founded conclusions of prioritized logic programs can be computed in polynomial time. A legal reasoning example illustrates the usefulness of the approach.
Logarithmic-Time Updates and Queries in Probabilistic Networks,1996-02-01T00:00:00Z,J. Pearl,"A. L. Delcher, A. J. Grove, S. Kasif, J. Pearl",cs.AI,"Traditional databases commonly support efficient query and update procedures that operate in time which is sublinear in the size of the database. Our goal in this paper is to take a first step toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic databases with comparable efficiency. We propose a dynamic data structure that supports efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected Bayesian networks. In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in O(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic databases. We briefly discuss a potential application of dynamic probabilistic reasoning in computational biology."
Quantum Computing and Phase Transitions in Combinatorial Search,1996-03-01T00:00:00Z,T. Hogg,T. Hogg,cs.AI,"We introduce an algorithm for combinatorial search on quantum computers that is capable of significantly concentrating amplitude into solutions for some NP search problems, on average. This is done by exploiting the same aspects of problem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive search choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions than the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same phase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously studied classical search methods. Specifically, difficult problem instances are concentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained problems."
Mean Field Theory for Sigmoid Belief Networks,1996-03-01T00:00:00Z,M. I. Jordan,"L. K. Saul, T. Jaakkola, M. I. Jordan",cs.AI,We develop a mean field theory for sigmoid belief networks based on ideas from statistical mechanics. Our mean field theory provides a tractable approximation to the true probability distribution in these networks; it also yields a lower bound on the likelihood of evidence. We demonstrate the utility of this framework on a benchmark problem in statistical pattern recognition---the classification of handwritten digits.
Improved Use of Continuous Attributes in C4.5,1996-03-01T00:00:00Z,J. R. Quinlan,J. R. Quinlan,cs.AI,"A reported weakness of C4.5 in domains with continuous attributes is addressed by modifying the formation and evaluation of tests on continuous attributes. An MDL-inspired penalty is applied to such tests, eliminating some of them from consideration and altering the relative desirability of all tests. Empirical trials show that the modifications lead to smaller decision trees with higher predictive accuracies. Results also confirm that a new version of C4.5 incorporating these changes is superior to recent approaches that use global discretization and that construct small trees with multi-interval splits."
Active Learning with Statistical Models,1996-03-01T00:00:00Z,M. I. Jordan,"D. A. Cohn, Z. Ghahramani, M. I. Jordan",cs.AI,"For many types of machine learning algorithms, one can compute the statistically `optimal' way to select training data. In this paper, we review how optimal data selection techniques have been used with feedforward neural networks. We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural networks are computationally expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are both efficient and accurate. Empirically, we observe that the optimality criterion sharply decreases the number of training examples the learner needs in order to achieve good performance."
A Divergence Critic for Inductive Proof,1996-04-01T00:00:00Z,T. Walsh,T. Walsh,cs.AI,"Inductive theorem provers often diverge. This paper describes a simple critic, a computer program which monitors the construction of inductive proofs attempting to identify diverging proof attempts. Divergence is recognized by means of a ``difference matching'' procedure. The critic then proposes lemmas and generalizations which ``ripple'' these differences away so that the proof can go through without divergence. The critic enables the theorem prover Spike to prove many theorems completely automatically from the definitions alone."
Practical Methods for Proving Termination of General Logic Programs,1996-04-01T00:00:00Z,E. Marchiori,E. Marchiori,cs.AI,"Termination of logic programs with negated body atoms (here called general logic programs) is an important topic. One reason is that many computational mechanisms used to process negated atoms, like Clark's negation as failure and Chan's constructive negation, are based on termination conditions. This paper introduces a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs w.r.t. the Prolog selection rule. The idea is to distinguish parts of the program depending on whether or not their termination depends on the selection rule. To this end, the notions of low-, weakly up-, and up-acceptable program are introduced. We use these notions to develop a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs, and show how interesting problems in non-monotonic reasoning can be formalized and implemented by means of terminating general logic programs."
Iterative Optimization and Simplification of Hierarchical Clusterings,1996-04-01T00:00:00Z,D. Fisher,D. Fisher,cs.AI,"Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and simplicity dimensions."
Further Experimental Evidence against the Utility of Occam's Razor,1996-05-01T00:00:00Z,G. I. Webb,G. I. Webb,cs.AI,"This paper presents new experimental evidence against the utility of Occam's razor. A~systematic procedure is presented for post-processing decision trees produced by C4.5. This procedure was derived by rejecting Occam's razor and instead attending to the assumption that similar objects are likely to belong to the same class. It increases a decision tree's complexity without altering the performance of that tree on the training data from which it is inferred. The resulting more complex decision trees are demonstrated to have, on average, for a variety of common learning tasks, higher predictive accuracy than the less complex original decision trees. This result raises considerable doubt about the utility of Occam's razor as it is commonly applied in modern machine learning."
Least Generalizations and Greatest Specializations of Sets of Clauses,1996-05-01T00:00:00Z,R. deWolf,"S. H. Nienhuys-Cheng, R. deWolf",cs.AI,"The main operations in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are generalization and specialization, which only make sense in a generality order. In ILP, the three most important generality orders are subsumption, implication and implication relative to background knowledge. The two languages used most often are languages of clauses and languages of only Horn clauses. This gives a total of six different ordered languages. In this paper, we give a systematic treatment of the existence or non-existence of least generalizations and greatest specializations of finite sets of clauses in each of these six ordered sets. We survey results already obtained by others and also contribute some answers of our own. Our main new results are, firstly, the existence of a computable least generalization under implication of every finite set of clauses containing at least one non-tautologous function-free clause (among other, not necessarily function-free clauses). Secondly, we show that such a least generalization need not exist under relative implication, not even if both the set that is to be generalized and the background knowledge are function-free. Thirdly, we give a complete discussion of existence and non-existence of greatest specializations in each of the six ordered languages."
Reinforcement Learning: A Survey,1996-05-01T00:00:00Z,A. W. Moore,"L. P. Kaelbling, M. L. Littman, A. W. Moore",cs.AI,"This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning."
Adaptive Problem-solving for Large-scale Scheduling Problems: A Case   Study,1996-05-01T00:00:00Z,S. Chien,"J. Gratch, S. Chien",cs.AI,"Although most scheduling problems are NP-hard, domain specific techniques perform well in practice but are quite expensive to construct. In adaptive problem-solving solving, domain specific knowledge is acquired automatically for a general problem solver with a flexible control architecture. In this approach, a learning system explores a space of possible heuristic methods for one well-suited to the eccentricities of the given domain and problem distribution. In this article, we discuss an application of the approach to scheduling satellite communications. Using problem distributions based on actual mission requirements, our approach identifies strategies that not only decrease the amount of CPU time required to produce schedules, but also increase the percentage of problems that are solvable within computational resource limitations."
A Formal Framework for Speedup Learning from Problems and Solutions,1996-05-01T00:00:00Z,B. K. Natarajan,"P. Tadepalli, B. K. Natarajan",cs.AI,"Speedup learning seeks to improve the computational efficiency of problem solving with experience. In this paper, we develop a formal framework for learning efficient problem solving from random problems and their solutions. We apply this framework to two different representations of learned knowledge, namely control rules and macro-operators, and prove theorems that identify sufficient conditions for learning in each representation. Our proofs are constructive in that they are accompanied with learning algorithms. Our framework captures both empirical and explanation-based speedup learning in a unified fashion. We illustrate our framework with implementations in two domains: symbolic integration and Eight Puzzle. This work integrates many strands of experimental and theoretical work in machine learning, including empirical learning of control rules, macro-operator learning, Explanation-Based Learning (EBL), and Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning."
2Planning for Contingencies: A Decision-based Approach,1996-05-01T00:00:00Z,G. Collins,"L. Pryor, G. Collins",cs.AI,"A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is that there is no uncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions under which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully predictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e., plans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In this paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order contingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The decision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are planned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes the process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions such as the use of different decision-making procedures."
A Principled Approach Towards Symbolic Geometric Constraint Satisfaction,1996-06-01T00:00:00Z,T. J. Hoar,"S. Bhansali, G. A. Kramer, T. J. Hoar",cs.AI,"An important problem in geometric reasoning is to find the configuration of a collection of geometric bodies so as to satisfy a set of given constraints. Recently, it has been suggested that this problem can be solved efficiently by symbolically reasoning about geometry. This approach, called degrees of freedom analysis, employs a set of specialized routines called plan fragments that specify how to change the configuration of a set of bodies to satisfy a new constraint while preserving existing constraints. A potential drawback, which limits the scalability of this approach, is concerned with the difficulty of writing plan fragments. In this paper we address this limitation by showing how these plan fragments can be automatically synthesized using first principles about geometric bodies, actions, and topology."
On Partially Controlled Multi-Agent Systems,1996-06-01T00:00:00Z,M. Tennenholtz,"R. I. Brafman, M. Tennenholtz",cs.AI,"Motivated by the control theoretic distinction between controllable and uncontrollable events, we distinguish between two types of agents within a multi-agent system: controllable agents, which are directly controlled by the system's designer, and uncontrollable agents, which are not under the designer's direct control. We refer to such systems as partially controlled multi-agent systems, and we investigate how one might influence the behavior of the uncontrolled agents through appropriate design of the controlled agents. In particular, we wish to understand which problems are naturally described in these terms, what methods can be applied to influence the uncontrollable agents, the effectiveness of such methods, and whether similar methods work across different domains. Using a game-theoretic framework, this paper studies the design of partially controlled multi-agent systems in two contexts: in one context, the uncontrollable agents are expected utility maximizers, while in the other they are reinforcement learners. We suggest different techniques for controlling agents' behavior in each domain, assess their success, and examine their relationship."
Spatial Aggregation: Theory and Applications,1996-08-01T00:00:00Z,F. Zhao,"K. Yip, F. Zhao",cs.AI,"Visual thinking plays an important role in scientific reasoning. Based on the research in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems, nonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have identified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure and behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three implemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of commonly used routines."
A Hierarchy of Tractable Subsets for Computing Stable Models,1996-08-01T00:00:00Z,R. Ben-Eliyahu,R. Ben-Eliyahu,cs.AI,"Finding the stable models of a knowledge base is a significant computational problem in artificial intelligence. This task is at the computational heart of truth maintenance systems, autoepistemic logic, and default logic. Unfortunately, it is NP-hard. In this paper we present a hierarchy of classes of knowledge bases, Omega_1,Omega_2,..., with the following properties: first, Omega_1 is the class of all stratified knowledge bases; second, if a knowledge base Pi is in Omega_k, then Pi has at most k stable models, and all of them may be found in time O(lnk), where l is the length of the knowledge base and n the number of atoms in Pi; third, for an arbitrary knowledge base Pi, we can find the minimum k such that Pi belongs to Omega_k in time polynomial in the size of Pi; and, last, where K is the class of all knowledge bases, it is the case that union{i=1 to infty} Omega_i = K, that is, every knowledge base belongs to some class in the hierarchy."
Accelerating Partial-Order Planners: Some Techniques for Effective   Search Control and Pruning,1996-09-01T00:00:00Z,L. Schubert,"A. Gerevini, L. Schubert",cs.AI,"We propose some domain-independent techniques for bringing well-founded partial-order planners closer to practicality. The first two techniques are aimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is based on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to select plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero commitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO prioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator parameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from the definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a polynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the operator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter domains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove spurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP, our improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors ranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial for the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest improvements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave speedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the default UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for our techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices."
Cue Phrase Classification Using Machine Learning,1996-09-01T00:00:00Z,D. J. Litman,D. J. Litman,cs.AI,"Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than structural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning programs (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data. Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and flexible than manual methods."
Mechanisms for Automated Negotiation in State Oriented Domains,1996-10-01T00:00:00Z,J. S. Rosenschein,"G. Zlotkin, J. S. Rosenschein",cs.AI,"This paper lays part of the groundwork for a domain theory of negotiation, that is, a way of classifying interactions so that it is clear, given a domain, which negotiation mechanisms and strategies are appropriate. We define State Oriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an altered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of joint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict resolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A Unified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types of encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a partial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents' goals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational agreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where agents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents. First we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we analyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase their utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents' goals (and therefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to their goals is private information. We introduce two mechanisms, one 'strict', the other 'tolerant', and analyze their affects on the stability and efficiency of negotiation outcomes."
Learning First-Order Definitions of Functions,1996-10-01T00:00:00Z,J. R. Quinlan,J. R. Quinlan,cs.AI,"First-order learning involves finding a clause-form definition of a relation from examples of the relation and relevant background information. In this paper, a particular first-order learning system is modified to customize it for finding definitions of functional relations. This restriction leads to faster learning times and, in some cases, to definitions that have higher predictive accuracy. Other first-order learning systems might benefit from similar specialization."
MUSE CSP: An Extension to the Constraint Satisfaction Problem,1996-11-01T00:00:00Z,M. P. Harper,"R. A Helzerman, M. P. Harper",cs.AI,"This paper describes an extension to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) called MUSE CSP (MUltiply SEgmented Constraint Satisfaction Problem). This extension is especially useful for those problems which segment into multiple sets of partially shared variables. Such problems arise naturally in signal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing, and handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to segment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by the segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent several similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple instances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and constraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP, reducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts of MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We then demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often generated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be used to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for MUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a MUSE CSP from a set of CSPs which are labeled to indicate when the same variable is shared by more than a single CSP."
Exploiting Causal Independence in Bayesian Network Inference,1996-12-01T00:00:00Z,D. Poole,"N. L. Zhang, D. Poole",cs.AI,"A new method is proposed for exploiting causal independencies in exact Bayesian network inference. A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as ``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms."
Quantitative Results Comparing Three Intelligent Interfaces for   Information Capture: A Case Study Adding Name Information into an Electronic   Personal Organizer,1996-12-01T00:00:00Z,P. C. Wells,"J. C. Schlimmer, P. C. Wells",cs.AI,"Efficiently entering information into a computer is key to enjoying the benefits of computing. This paper describes three intelligent user interfaces: handwriting recognition, adaptive menus, and predictive fillin. In the context of adding a personUs name and address to an electronic organizer, tests show handwriting recognition is slower than typing on an on-screen, soft keyboard, while adaptive menus and predictive fillin can be twice as fast. This paper also presents strategies for applying these three interfaces to other information collection domains."
Characterizations of Decomposable Dependency Models,1996-12-01T00:00:00Z,L. M. deCampos,L. M. deCampos,cs.AI,"Decomposable dependency models possess a number of interesting and useful properties. This paper presents new characterizations of decomposable models in terms of independence relationships, which are obtained by adding a single axiom to the well-known set characterizing dependency models that are isomorphic to undirected graphs. We also briefly discuss a potential application of our results to the problem of learning graphical models from data."
Improved Heterogeneous Distance Functions,1997-01-01T00:00:00Z,T. R. Martinez,"D. R. Wilson, T. R. Martinez",cs.AI,"Instance-based learning techniques typically handle continuous and linear input values well, but often do not handle nominal input attributes appropriately. The Value Difference Metric (VDM) was designed to find reasonable distance values between nominal attribute values, but it largely ignores continuous attributes, requiring discretization to map continuous values into nominal values. This paper proposes three new heterogeneous distance functions, called the Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM), the Interpolated Value Difference Metric (IVDM), and the Windowed Value Difference Metric (WVDM). These new distance functions are designed to handle applications with nominal attributes, continuous attributes, or both. In experiments on 48 applications the new distance metrics achieve higher classification accuracy on average than three previous distance functions on those datasets that have both nominal and continuous attributes."
SCREEN: Learning a Flat Syntactic and Semantic Spoken Language Analysis   Using Artificial Neural Networks,1997-01-01T00:00:00Z,V. Weber,"S. Wermter, V. Weber",cs.AI,"Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have been based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and symbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework."
A Uniform Framework for Concept Definitions in Description Logics,1997-03-01T00:00:00Z,M. Lenzerini,"G. DeGiacomo, M. Lenzerini",cs.AI,"Most modern formalisms used in Databases and Artificial Intelligence for describing an application domain are based on the notions of class (or concept) and relationship among classes. One interesting feature of such formalisms is the possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that precisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition containing some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a formalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the feasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation formalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In addition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers, and qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of recursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc. We establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the computational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus."
Lifeworld Analysis,1997-04-01T00:00:00Z,I. Horswill,"P. Agre, I. Horswill",cs.AI,"We argue that the analysis of agent/environment interactions should be extended to include the conventions and invariants maintained by agents throughout their activity. We refer to this thicker notion of environment as a lifeworld and present a partial set of formal tools for describing structures of lifeworlds and the ways in which they computationally simplify activity. As one specific example, we apply the tools to the analysis of the Toast system and show how versions of the system with very different control structures in fact implement a common control structure together with different conventions for encoding task state in the positions or states of objects in the environment."
Query DAGs: A Practical Paradigm for Implementing Belief-Network   Inference,1997-05-01T00:00:00Z,G. Provan,"A. Darwiche, G. Provan",cs.AI,"We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks, which consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple evaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest. It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation algorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes: simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex optimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning and computation-caching."
Connectionist Theory Refinement: Genetically Searching the Space of   Network Topologies,1997-05-01T00:00:00Z,J. W. Shavlik,"D. W. Opitz, J. W. Shavlik",cs.AI,"An algorithm that learns from a set of examples should ideally be able to exploit the available resources of (a) abundant computing power and (b) domain-specific knowledge to improve its ability to generalize. Connectionist theory-refinement systems, which use background knowledge to select a neural network's topology and initial weights, have proven to be effective at exploiting domain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit available computing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to refine the topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby limiting generalization, especially when given impoverished domain theories. We present the REGENT algorithm which uses (a) domain-specific knowledge to help create an initial population of knowledge-based neural networks and (b) genetic operators of crossover and mutation (specifically designed for knowledge-based networks) to continually search for better network topologies. Experiments on three real-world domains indicate that our new algorithm is able to significantly increase generalization compared to a standard connectionist theory-refinement system, as well as our previous algorithm for growing knowledge-based networks."
Flaw Selection Strategies for Partial-Order Planning,1997-06-01T00:00:00Z,M. Paolucci,"M. E. Pollack, D. Joslin, M. Paolucci",cs.AI,"Several recent studies have compared the relative efficiency of alternative flaw selection strategies for partial-order causal link (POCL) planning. We review this literature, and present new experimental results that generalize the earlier work and explain some of the discrepancies in it. In particular, we describe the Least-Cost Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by Joslin and Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy. LCFR and ZLIFO make very different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to reduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing that much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO component of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show that for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with the delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size, and will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain characteristics may reduce its effectiveness."
A Complete Classification of Tractability in RCC-5,1997-06-01T00:00:00Z,T. Drakengren,"P. Jonsson, T. Drakengren",cs.AI,"We investigate the computational properties of the spatial algebra RCC-5 which is a restricted version of the RCC framework for spatial reasoning. The satisfiability problem for RCC-5 is known to be NP-complete but not much is known about its approximately four billion subclasses. We provide a complete classification of satisfiability for all these subclasses into polynomial and NP-complete respectively. In the process, we identify all maximal tractable subalgebras which are four in total."
A New Look at the Easy-Hard-Easy Pattern of Combinatorial Search   Difficulty,1997-07-01T00:00:00Z,T. Hogg,"D. L. Mammen, T. Hogg",cs.AI,"The easy-hard-easy pattern in the difficulty of combinatorial search problems as constraints are added has been explained as due to a competition between the decrease in number of solutions and increased pruning. We test the generality of this explanation by examining one of its predictions: if the number of solutions is held fixed by the choice of problems, then increased pruning should lead to a monotonic decrease in search cost. Instead, we find the easy-hard-easy pattern in median search cost even when the number of solutions is held constant, for some search methods. This generalizes previous observations of this pattern and shows that the existing theory does not explain the full range of the peak in search cost. In these cases the pattern appears to be due to changes in the size of the minimal unsolvable subproblems, rather than changing numbers of solutions."
Eight Maximal Tractable Subclasses of Allen's Algebra with Metric Time,1997-07-01T00:00:00Z,P. Jonsson,"T. Drakengren, P. Jonsson",cs.AI,"This paper combines two important directions of research in temporal resoning: that of finding maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra, and that of reasoning with metric temporal information. Eight new maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra are presented, some of them subsuming previously reported tractable algebras. The algebras allow for metric temporal constraints on interval starting or ending points, using the recent framework of Horn DLRs. Two of the algebras can express the notion of sequentiality between intervals, being the first such algebras admitting both qualitative and metric time."
Defining Relative Likelihood in Partially-Ordered Preferential Structures,1997-07-01T00:00:00Z,J. Y. Halpern,J. Y. Halpern,cs.AI,"Starting with a likelihood or preference order on worlds, we extend it to a likelihood ordering on sets of worlds in a natural way, and examine the resulting logic. Lewis earlier considered such a notion of relative likelihood in the context of studying counterfactuals, but he assumed a total preference order on worlds. Complications arise when examining partial orders that are not present for total orders. There are subtleties involving the exact approach to lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds. In addition, the axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of partial orders gives insight into the connection between relative likelihood and default reasoning."
Towards Flexible Teamwork,1997-09-01T00:00:00Z,M. Tambe,M. Tambe,cs.AI,"Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex, dynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as education, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their domain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination and communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing consistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork, called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions (Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a (partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel Grosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members monitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM ensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate sensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's application in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical results."
Identifying Hierarchical Structure in Sequences: A linear-time algorithm,1997-09-01T00:00:00Z,I. H. Witten,"C. G. Nevill-Manning, I. H. Witten",cs.AI,"SEQUITUR is an algorithm that infers a hierarchical structure from a sequence of discrete symbols by replacing repeated phrases with a grammatical rule that generates the phrase, and continuing this process recursively. The result is a hierarchical representation of the original sequence, which offers insights into its lexical structure. The algorithm is driven by two constraints that reduce the size of the grammar, and produce structure as a by-product. SEQUITUR breaks new ground by operating incrementally. Moreover, the method's simple structure permits a proof that it operates in space and time that is linear in the size of the input. Our implementation can process 50,000 symbols per second and has been applied to an extensive range of real world sequences."
Storing and Indexing Plan Derivations through Explanation-based Analysis   of Retrieval Failures,1997-11-01T00:00:00Z,S. Kambhampati,"L. H. Ihrig, S. Kambhampati",cs.AI,"Case-Based Planning (CBP) provides a way of scaling up domain-independent planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner DERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this approach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval failure."
A Model Approximation Scheme for Planning in Partially Observable   Stochastic Domains,1997-11-01T00:00:00Z,W. Liu,"N. L. Zhang, W. Liu",cs.AI,"Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a natural model for planning problems where effects of actions are nondeterministic and the state of the world is not completely observable. It is difficult to solve POMDPs exactly. This paper proposes a new approximation scheme. The basic idea is to transform a POMDP into another one where additional information is provided by an oracle. The oracle informs the planning agent that the current state of the world is in a certain region. The transformed POMDP is consequently said to be region observable. It is easier to solve than the original POMDP. We propose to solve the transformed POMDP and use its optimal policy to construct an approximate policy for the original POMDP. By controlling the amount of additional information that the oracle provides, it is possible to find a proper tradeoff between computational time and approximation quality. In terms of algorithmic contributions, we study in details how to exploit region observability in solving the transformed POMDP. To facilitate the study, we also propose a new exact algorithm for general POMDPs. The algorithm is conceptually simple and yet is significantly more efficient than all previous exact algorithms."
Dynamic Non-Bayesian Decision Making,1997-11-01T00:00:00Z,M. Tennenholtz,"D. Monderer, M. Tennenholtz",cs.AI,"The model of a non-Bayesian agent who faces a repeated game with incomplete information against Nature is an appropriate tool for modeling general agent-environment interactions. In such a model the environment state (controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are considered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the other -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run optimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect monitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from previous work in this area."
When Gravity Fails: Local Search Topology,1997-12-01T00:00:00Z,J. Stutz,"J. Frank, P. Cheeseman, J. Stutz",cs.AI,"Local search algorithms for combinatorial search problems frequently encounter a sequence of states in which it is impossible to improve the value of the objective function; moves through these regions, called plateau moves, dominate the time spent in local search. We analyze and characterize plateaus for three different classes of randomly generated Boolean Satisfiability problems. We identify several interesting features of plateaus that impact the performance of local search algorithms. We show that local minima tend to be small but occasionally may be very large. We also show that local minima can be escaped without unsatisfying a large number of clauses, but that systematically searching for an escape route may be computationally expensive if the local minimum is large. We show that plateaus with exits, called benches, tend to be much larger than minima, and that some benches have very few exit states which local search can use to escape. We show that the solutions (i.e., global minima) of randomly generated problem instances form clusters, which behave similarly to local minima. We revisit several enhancements of local search algorithms and explain their performance in light of our results. Finally we discuss strategies for creating the next generation of local search algorithms."
Bidirectional Heuristic Search Reconsidered,1997-12-01T00:00:00Z,G. Kainz,"H. Kaindl, G. Kainz",cs.AI,"The assessment of bidirectional heuristic search has been incorrect since it was first published more than a quarter of a century ago. For quite a long time, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was a major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding. Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding unidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a search strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional heuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered."
Incremental Recompilation of Knowledge,1998-01-01T00:00:00Z,M. Sideri,"G. Gogic, C. H. Papadimitriou, M. Sideri",cs.AI,"Approximating a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn envelope and Horn core, respectively) was proposed by Selman and Kautz (1991, 1996) as a form of ``knowledge compilation,'' supporting rapid approximate reasoning; on the negative side, this scheme is static in that it supports no updates, and has certain complexity drawbacks pointed out by Kavvadias, Papadimitriou and Sideri (1993). On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob (1992), and is further demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a single update any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for more complex updates."
Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics,1998-01-01T00:00:00Z,J. Engelfriet,J. Engelfriet,cs.AI,"An important characteristic of many logics for Artificial Intelligence is their nonmonotonicity. This means that adding a formula to the premises can invalidate some of the consequences. There may, however, exist formulae that can always be safely added to the premises without destroying any of the consequences: we say they respect monotonicity. Also, there may be formulae that, when they are a consequence, can not be invalidated when adding any formula to the premises: we call them conservative. We study these two classes of formulae for preferential logics, and show that they are closely linked to the formulae whose truth-value is preserved along the (preferential) ordering. We will consider some preferential logics for illustration, and prove syntactic characterization results for them. The results in this paper may improve the efficiency of theorem provers for preferential logics."
Synthesizing Customized Planners from Specifications,1998-03-01T00:00:00Z,S. Kambhampati,"B. Srivastava, S. Kambhampati",cs.AI,"Existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial intelligence fall into two categories -- domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very efficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be (re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the domain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis tools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used to derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a declarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific to a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive domain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative theory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach by generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space refinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform classical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP, Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will contrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional methods for customizing domain independent planners."
Cached Sufficient Statistics for Efficient Machine Learning with Large   Datasets,1998-03-01T00:00:00Z,M. S. Lee,"A. Moore, M. S. Lee",cs.AI,"This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting for machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing contingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero entries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets."
Tractability of Theory Patching,1998-03-01T00:00:00Z,M. Koppel,"S. Argamon-Engelson, M. Koppel",cs.AI,"In this paper we consider the problem of `theory patching', in which we are given a domain theory, some of whose components are indicated to be possibly flawed, and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept. The theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the theory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions are made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching problem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain theories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of determining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of what revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining stability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that revisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification of examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification of examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used to determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching algorithms."
Integrative Windowing,1998-05-01T00:00:00Z,J. Fuernkranz,J. Fuernkranz,cs.AI,"In this paper we re-investigate windowing for rule learning algorithms. We show that, contrary to previous results for decision tree learning, windowing can in fact achieve significant run-time gains in noise-free domains and explain the different behavior of rule learning algorithms by the fact that they learn each rule independently. The main contribution of this paper is integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this property by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of noise-free domains shows that integrative windowing can in fact achieve substantial run-time gains. Furthermore, we discuss the problem of noise in windowing and present an algorithm that is able to achieve run-time gains in a set of experiments in a simple domain with artificial noise."
Model-Based Diagnosis using Structured System Descriptions,1998-06-01T00:00:00Z,A. Darwiche,A. Darwiche,cs.AI,"This paper presents a comprehensive approach for model-based diagnosis which includes proposals for characterizing and computing preferred diagnoses, assuming that the system description is augmented with a system structure (a directed graph explicating the interconnections between system components). Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies some general conditions."
A Selective Macro-learning Algorithm and its Application to the NxN   Sliding-Tile Puzzle,1998-06-01T00:00:00Z,S. Markovitch,"L. Finkelstein, S. Markovitch",cs.AI,"One of the most common mechanisms used for speeding up problem solvers is macro-learning. Macros are sequences of basic operators acquired during problem solving. Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were basic operators. The major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros that are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the search space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro learning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros. This paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros. Solvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The only macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local minimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several domains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles. After learning on small puzzles, the system is able to efficiently solve puzzles of any size."
The Computational Complexity of Probabilistic Planning,1998-08-01T00:00:00Z,M. Mundhenk,"M. L. Littman, J. Goldsmith, M. Mundhenk",cs.AI,"We examine the computational complexity of testing and finding small plans in probabilistic planning domains with both flat and propositional representations. The complexity of plan evaluation and existence varies with the plan type sought; we examine totally ordered plans, acyclic plans, and looping plans, and partially ordered plans under three natural definitions of plan value. We show that problems of interest are complete for a variety of complexity classes: PL, P, NP, co-NP, PP, NP^PP, co-NP^PP, and PSPACE. In the process of proving that certain planning problems are complete for NP^PP, we introduce a new basic NP^PP-complete problem, E-MAJSAT, which generalizes the standard Boolean satisfiability problem to computations involving probabilistic quantities; our results suggest that the development of good heuristics for E-MAJSAT could be important for the creation of efficient algorithms for a wide variety of problems."
SYNERGY: A Linear Planner Based on Genetic Programming,1998-10-16T22:11:35Z,Ion Muslea,Ion Muslea,cs.AI,"In this paper we describe SYNERGY, which is a highly parallelizable, linear planning system that is based on the genetic programming paradigm. Rather than reasoning about the world it is planning for, SYNERGY uses artificial selection, recombination and fitness measure to generate linear plans that solve conjunctive goals. We ran SYNERGY on several domains (e.g., the briefcase problem and a few variants of the robot navigation problem), and the experimental results show that our planner is capable of handling problem instances that are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the ones solved by UCPOP. In order to facilitate the search reduction and to enhance the expressive power of SYNERGY, we also propose two major extensions to our planning system: a formalism for using hierarchical planning operators, and a framework for planning in dynamic environments."
The Essence of Constraint Propagation,1998-11-13T13:04:02Z,Krzysztof R. Apt,Krzysztof R. Apt,cs.AI,"We show that several constraint propagation algorithms (also called (local) consistency, consistency enforcing, Waltz, filtering or narrowing algorithms) are instances of algorithms that deal with chaotic iteration. To this end we propose a simple abstract framework that allows us to classify and compare these algorithms and to establish in a uniform way their basic properties."
Towards a computational theory of human daydreaming,1998-12-10T16:29:07Z,Michael G. Dyer,"Erik T. Mueller, Michael G. Dyer",cs.AI,"This paper examines the phenomenon of daydreaming: spontaneously recalling or imagining personal or vicarious experiences in the past or future. The following important roles of daydreaming in human cognition are postulated: plan preparation and rehearsal, learning from failures and successes, support for processes of creativity, emotion regulation, and motivation.   A computational theory of daydreaming and its implementation as the program DAYDREAMER are presented. DAYDREAMER consists of 1) a scenario generator based on relaxed planning, 2) a dynamic episodic memory of experiences used by the scenario generator, 3) a collection of personal goals and control goals which guide the scenario generator, 4) an emotion component in which daydreams initiate, and are initiated by, emotional states arising from goal outcomes, and 5) domain knowledge of interpersonal relations and common everyday occurrences.   The role of emotions and control goals in daydreaming is discussed. Four control goals commonly used in guiding daydreaming are presented: rationalization, failure/success reversal, revenge, and preparation. The role of episodic memory in daydreaming is considered, including how daydreamed information is incorporated into memory and later used. An initial version of DAYDREAMER which produces several daydreams (in English) is currently running."
A reusable iterative optimization software library to solve   combinatorial problems with approximate reasoning,1998-12-15T21:45:15Z,Wolfgang Slany,"Andreas Raggl, Wolfgang Slany",cs.AI,"Real world combinatorial optimization problems such as scheduling are typically too complex to solve with exact methods. Additionally, the problems often have to observe vaguely specified constraints of different importance, the available data may be uncertain, and compromises between antagonistic criteria may be necessary. We present a combination of approximate reasoning based constraints and iterative optimization based heuristics that help to model and solve such problems in a framework of C++ software libraries called StarFLIP++. While initially developed to schedule continuous caster units in steel plants, we present in this paper results from reusing the library components in a shift scheduling system for the workforce of an industrial production plant."
"Modeling Belief in Dynamic Systems, Part II: Revision and Update",1999-03-24T00:22:01Z,J. Y. Halpern,"N Friedman, J. Y. Halpern",cs.AI,"The study of belief change has been an active area in philosophy and AI. In recent years two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief update, have been studied in detail. In a companion paper (Friedman & Halpern, 1997), we introduce a new framework to model belief change. This framework combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility, allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better understand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991a) depends on several strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial intelligence. Finally, our analysis allow us to identify a notion of minimal change that underlies a broad range of belief change operations including revision and update."
The Symbol Grounding Problem,1999-06-01T19:57:24Z,Stevan Harnad,Stevan Harnad,cs.AI,"How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) ""iconic representations,"" which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) ""categorical representations,"" which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) ""symbolic representations,"" grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., ""An X is a Y that is Z"")."
Iterative Deepening Branch and Bound,1999-09-03T10:31:46Z,R. N. Behera,"S. Mohanty, R. N. Behera",cs.AI,"In tree search problem the best-first search algorithm needs too much of space . To remove such drawbacks of these algorithms the IDA* was developed which is both space and time cost efficient. But again IDA* can give an optimal solution for real valued problems like Flow shop scheduling, Travelling Salesman and 0/1 Knapsack due to their real valued cost estimates. Thus further modifications are done on it and the Iterative Deepening Branch and Bound Search Algorithms is developed which meets the requirements. We have tried using this algorithm for the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem and have found that it is quite effective."
Probabilistic Agent Programs,1999-10-21T09:35:38Z,VS Subrahmanian,"Juergen Dix, Mirco Nanni, VS Subrahmanian",cs.AI,"Agents are small programs that autonomously take actions based on changes in their environment or ``state.'' Over the last few years, there have been an increasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and/or collaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts, Eiter, Subrahmanian amd Pick (AIJ, 108(1-2), pages 179-255) have shown how agents may be built on top of legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are completely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent's state. Thus, their framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react when the agent is 100% sure about what is true/false in the world state. In this paper, we propose the concept of a \emph{probabilistic agent program} and show how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may build a declarative ``probabilistic'' agent program on top of it which supports decision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative semantics for probabilistic agent programs. We show that the second semantics, though more epistemically appealing, is more complex to compute. We provide sound and complete algorithms to compute the semantics of \emph{positive} agent programs."
Cox's Theorem Revisited,1999-11-27T17:57:17Z,Joseph Y. Halpern,Joseph Y. Halpern,cs.AI,"The assumptions needed to prove Cox's Theorem are discussed and examined. Various sets of assumptions under which a Cox-style theorem can be proved are provided, although all are rather strong and, arguably, not natural."
Uniform semantic treatment of default and autoepistemic logics,2000-02-03T21:44:57Z,Miroslaw Truszczynski,"Marc Denecker, Victor W. Marek, Miroslaw Truszczynski",cs.AI,"We revisit the issue of connections between two leading formalisms in nonmonotonic reasoning: autoepistemic logic and default logic. For each logic we develop a comprehensive semantic framework based on the notion of a belief pair. The set of all belief pairs together with the so called knowledge ordering forms a complete lattice. For each logic, we introduce several semantics by means of fixpoints of operators on the lattice of belief pairs. Our results elucidate an underlying isomorphism of the respective semantic constructions. In particular, we show that the interpretation of defaults as modal formulas proposed by Konolige allows us to represent all semantics for default logic in terms of the corresponding semantics for autoepistemic logic. Thus, our results conclusively establish that default logic can indeed be viewed as a fragment of autoepistemic logic. However, as we also demonstrate, the semantics of Moore and Reiter are given by different operators and occupy different locations in their corresponding families of semantics. This result explains the source of the longstanding difficulty to formally relate these two semantics. In the paper, we also discuss approximating skeptical reasoning with autoepistemic and default logics and establish constructive principles behind such approximations."
On the accuracy and running time of GSAT,2000-02-04T12:53:57Z,Miroslaw Truszczynski,"Deborah East, Miroslaw Truszczynski",cs.AI,"Randomized algorithms for deciding satisfiability were shown to be effective in solving problems with thousands of variables. However, these algorithms are not complete. That is, they provide no guarantee that a satisfying assignment, if one exists, will be found. Thus, when studying randomized algorithms, there are two important characteristics that need to be considered: the running time and, even more importantly, the accuracy --- a measure of likelihood that a satisfying assignment will be found, provided one exists. In fact, we argue that without a reference to the accuracy, the notion of the running time for randomized algorithms is not well-defined. In this paper, we introduce a formal notion of accuracy. We use it to define a concept of the running time. We use both notions to study the random walk strategy GSAT algorithm. We investigate the dependence of accuracy on properties of input formulas such as clause-to-variable ratio and the number of satisfying assignments. We demonstrate that the running time of GSAT grows exponentially in the number of variables of the input formula for randomly generated 3-CNF formulas and for the formulas encoding 3- and 4-colorability of graphs."
Syntactic Autonomy: Why There is no Autonomy without Symbols and How   Self-Organization Might Evolve Them,2000-02-16T18:09:20Z,Luis M. Rocha,Luis M. Rocha,cs.AI,"Two different types of agency are discussed based on dynamically coherent and incoherent couplings with an environment respectively. I propose that until a private syntax (syntactic autonomy) is discovered by dynamically coherent agents, there are no significant or interesting types of closure or autonomy. When syntactic autonomy is established, then, because of a process of description-based selected self-organization, open-ended evolution is enabled. At this stage, agents depend, in addition to dynamics, on localized, symbolic memory, thus adding a level of dynamical incoherence to their interaction with the environment. Furthermore, it is the appearance of syntactic autonomy which enables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the same syntax. To investigate how we can study the emergence of syntax from dynamical systems, experiments with cellular automata leading to emergent computation to solve non-trivial tasks are discussed. RNA editing is also mentioned as a process that may have been used to obtain a primordial biological code necessary open-ended evolution."
Consistency Management of Normal Logic Program by Top-down Abductive   Proof Procedure,2000-03-05T10:29:03Z,Ken Satoh,Ken Satoh,cs.AI,"This paper presents a method of computing a revision of a function-free normal logic program. If an added rule is inconsistent with a program, that is, if it leads to a situation such that no stable model exists for a new program, then deletion and addition of rules are performed to avoid inconsistency. We specify a revision by translating a normal logic program into an abductive logic program with abducibles to represent deletion and addition of rules. To compute such deletion and addition, we propose an adaptation of our top-down abductive proof procedure to compute a relevant abducibles to an added rule. We compute a minimally revised program, by choosing a minimal set of abducibles among all the sets of abducibles computed by a top-down proof procedure."

Abductive and Consistency-Based Diagnosis Revisited: a Modeling   Perspective,2000-03-07T11:39:53Z,Daniele Theseider Dupre',Daniele Theseider Dupre',cs.AI,"Diagnostic reasoning has been characterized logically as consistency-based reasoning or abductive reasoning. Previous analyses in the literature have shown, on the one hand, that choosing the (in general more restrictive) abductive definition may be appropriate or not, depending on the content of the knowledge base [Console&Torasso91], and, on the other hand, that, depending on the choice of the definition the same knowledge should be expressed in different form [Poole94].   Since in Model-Based Diagnosis a major problem is finding the right way of abstracting the behavior of the system to be modeled, this paper discusses the relation between modeling, and in particular abstraction in the model, and the notion of diagnosis."
ACLP: Integrating Abduction and Constraint Solving,2000-03-07T22:47:13Z,Antonis Kakas,Antonis Kakas,cs.AI,"ACLP is a system which combines abductive reasoning and constraint solving by integrating the frameworks of Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) and Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). It forms a general high-level knowledge representation environment for abductive problems in Artificial Intelligence and other areas. In ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial integration with constraint solving facilitating its application to complex problems. The ACLP system is currently implemented on top of the CLP language of ECLiPSe as a meta-interpreter exploiting its underlying constraint solver for finite domains. It has been applied to the problems of planning and scheduling in order to test its computational effectiveness compared with the direct use of the (lower level) constraint solving framework of CLP on which it is built. These experiments provide evidence that the abductive framework of ACLP does not compromise significantly the computational efficiency of the solutions. Other experiments show the natural ability of ACLP to accommodate easily and in a robust way new or changing requirements of the original problem."
Relevance Sensitive Non-Monotonic Inference on Belief Sequences,2000-03-08T03:03:36Z,Rohit Parikh,"Samir Chopra, Konstantinos Georgatos, Rohit Parikh",cs.AI,"We present a method for relevance sensitive non-monotonic inference from belief sequences which incorporates insights pertaining to prioritized inference and relevance sensitive, inconsistency tolerant belief revision.  Our model uses a finite, logically open sequence of propositional formulas as a representation for beliefs and defines a notion of inference from maxiconsistent subsets of formulas guided by two orderings: a temporal sequencing and an ordering based on relevance relations between the conclusion and formulas in the sequence. The relevance relations are ternary (using context as a parameter) as opposed to standard binary axiomatizations. The inference operation thus defined easily handles iterated revision by maintaining a revision history, blocks the derivation of inconsistent answers from a possibly inconsistent sequence and maintains the distinction between explicit and implicit beliefs. In doing so, it provides a finitely presented formalism and a plausible model of reasoning for automated agents."
Probabilistic Default Reasoning with Conditional Constraints,2000-03-08T11:05:45Z,Thomas Lukasiewicz,Thomas Lukasiewicz,cs.AI,"We propose a combination of probabilistic reasoning from conditional constraints with approaches to default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases. In detail, we generalize the notions of Pearl's entailment in system Z, Lehmann's lexicographic entailment, and Geffner's conditional entailment to conditional constraints. We give some examples that show that the new notions of z-, lexicographic, and conditional entailment have similar properties like their classical counterparts. Moreover, we show that the new notions of z-, lexicographic, and conditional entailment are proper generalizations of both their classical counterparts and the classical notion of logical entailment for conditional constraints."
A Compiler for Ordered Logic Programs,2000-03-08T10:15:51Z,Hans Tompits,"James P. Delgrande, Torsten Schaub, Hans Tompits",cs.AI,"This paper describes a system, called PLP, for compiling ordered logic programs into standard logic programs under the answer set semantics. In an ordered logic program, rules are named by unique terms, and preferences among rules are given by a set of dedicated atoms. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed theory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Since the result of the translation is an extended logic program, existing logic programming systems can be used as underlying reasoning engine. In particular, PLP is conceived as a front-end to the logic programming systems dlv and smodels."

Logic Programs with Compiled Preferences,2000-03-08T14:09:56Z,Hans Tompits,"James P.

An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed theory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Our approach allows both the specification of static orderings (as found in most previous work), in which preferences are external to a logic program, as well as orderings on sets of rules. In large part then, we are interested in describing a general methodology for uniformly incorporating preference information in a logic program. Since the result of our translation is an extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a compiler, available on the web, as a front-end for these programming systems."

Optimal Belief Revision,2000-03-08T15:54:50Z,Robert E. Mercer,"Carmen Vodislav, Robert E. Mercer",cs.AI,"We propose a new approach to belief revision that provides a way to change knowledge bases with a minimum of effort. We call this way of revising belief states optimal belief revision. Our revision method gives special attention to the fact that most belief revision processes are directed to a specific informational objective. This approach to belief change is founded on notions such as optimal context and accessibility. For the sentential model of belief states we provide both a formal description of contexts as sub-theories determined by three parameters and a method to construct contexts. Next, we introduce an accessibility ordering for belief sets, which we then use for selecting the best (optimal) contexts with respect to the processing effort involved in the revision. Then, for finitely axiomatizable knowledge bases, we characterize a finite accessibility ranking from which the accessibility ordering for the entire base is generated and show how to determine the ranking of an arbitrary sentence in the language. Finally, we define the adjustment of the accessibility ranking of a revised base of a belief set."
cc-Golog: Towards More Realistic Logic-Based Robot Controllers,2000-03-08T16:14:08Z,Gerhard Lakemeyer,"Henrik Grosskreutz, Gerhard Lakemeyer",cs.AI,"High-level robot controllers in realistic domains typically deal with processes which operate concurrently, change the world continuously, and where the execution of actions is event-driven as in ``charge the batteries as soon as the voltage level is low''. While non-logic-based robot control languages are well suited to express such scenarios, they fare poorly when it comes to projecting, in a conspicuous way, how the world evolves when actions are executed. On the other hand, a logic-based control language like \congolog, based on the situation calculus, is well-suited for the latter. However, it has problems expressing event-driven behavior. In this paper, we show how these problems can be overcome by first extending the situation calculus to support continuous change and event-driven behavior and then presenting \ccgolog, a variant of \congolog which is based on the extended situation calculus. One benefit of \ccgolog is that it narrows the gap in expressiveness compared to non-logic-based control languages while preserving a semantically well-founded projection mechanism."
Smodels: A System for Answer Set Programming,2000-03-08T23:25:51Z,Tommi Syrjanen,"Ilkka Niemela, Patrik Simons, Tommi Syrjanen",cs.AI,"The Smodels system implements the stable model semantics for normal logic programs. It handles a subclass of programs which contain no function symbols and are domain-restricted but supports extensions including built-in functions as well as cardinality and weight constraints. On top of this core engine more involved systems can be built. As an example, we have implemented total and partial stable model computation for disjunctive logic programs. An interesting application method is based on answer set programming, i.e., encoding an application problem as a set of rules so that its solutions are captured by the stable models of the rules. Smodels has been applied to a number of areas including planning, model checking, reachability analysis, product configuration, dynamic constraint satisfaction, and feature interaction."
"E-RES: A System for Reasoning about Actions, Events and Observations",2000-03-08T16:18:52Z,Francesca Toni,"Antonis Kakas, Rob Miller, Francesca Toni",cs.AI,"E-RES is a system that implements the Language E, a logic for reasoning about narratives of action occurrences and observations. E's semantics is model-theoretic, but this implementation is based on a sound and complete reformulation of E in terms of argumentation, and uses general computational techniques of argumentation frameworks. The system derives sceptical non-monotonic consequences of a given reformulated theory which exactly correspond to consequences entailed by E's model-theory. The computation relies on a complimentary ability of the system to derive credulous non-monotonic consequences together with a set of supporting assumptions which is sufficient for the (credulous) conclusion to hold. E-RES allows theories to contain general action laws, statements about action occurrences, observations and statements of ramifications (or universal laws). It is able to derive consequences both forward and backward in time. This paper gives a short overview of the theoretical basis of E-RES and illustrates its use on a variety of examples. Currently, E-RES is being extended so that the system can be used for planning."

A Splitting Set Theorem for Epistemic Specifications,2000-03-08T20:40:31Z,Richard Watson,Richard Watson,cs.AI,"Over the past decade a considerable amount of research has been done to expand logic programming languages to handle incomplete information. One such language is the language of epistemic specifications. As is usual with logic programming languages, the problem of answering queries is intractable in the general case. For extended disjunctive logic programs, an idea that has proven useful in simplifying the investigation of answer sets is the use of splitting sets. In this paper we will present an extended definition of splitting sets that will be applicable to epistemic specifications. Furthermore, an extension of the splitting set theorem will be presented. Also, a characterization of stratified epistemic specifications will be given in terms of splitting sets. This characterization leads us to an algorithmic method of computing world views of a subclass of epistemic logic programs."
DES: a Challenge Problem for Nonmonotonic Reasoning Systems,2000-03-08T21:49:57Z,Ilkka Niemela,"Maarit Hietalahti, Fabio Massacci, Ilkka Niemela",cs.AI,"The US Data Encryption Standard, DES for short, is put forward as an interesting benchmark problem for nonmonotonic reasoning systems because (i) it provides a set of test cases of industrial relevance which shares features of randomly generated problems and real-world problems, (ii) the representation of DES using normal logic programs with the stable model semantics is simple and easy to understand, and (iii) this subclass of logic programs can be seen as an interesting special case for many other formalizations of nonmonotonic reasoning. In this paper we present two encodings of DES as logic programs: a direct one out of the standard specifications and an optimized one extending the work of Massacci and Marraro. The computational properties of the encodings are studied by using them for DES key search with the Smodels system as the implementation of the stable model semantics. Results indicate that the encodings and Smodels are quite competitive: they outperform state-of-the-art SAT-checkers working with an optimized encoding of DES into SAT and are comparable with a SAT-checker that is customized and tuned for the optimized SAT encoding."
Fages' Theorem and Answer Set Programming,2000-03-09T00:28:21Z,Vladimir Lifschitz,"Yuliya Babovich, Esra Erdem, Vladimir Lifschitz",cs.AI,"We generalize a theorem by Francois Fages that describes the relationship between the completion semantics and the answer set semantics for logic programs with negation as failure. The study of this relationship is important in connection with the emergence of answer set programming. Whenever the two semantics are equivalent, answer sets can be computed by a satisfiability solver, and the use of answer set solvers such as smodels and dlv is unnecessary. A logic programming representation of the blocks world due to Ilkka Niemelae is discussed as an example."
On the tractable counting of theory models and its application to belief   revision and truth maintenance,2000-03-09T08:58:15Z,Adnan Darwiche,Adnan Darwiche,cs.AI,"We introduced decomposable negation normal form (DNNF) recently as a tractable form of propositional theories, and provided a number of powerful logical operations that can be performed on it in polynomial time. We also presented an algorithm for compiling any conjunctive normal form (CNF) into DNNF and provided a structure-based guarantee on its space and time complexity. We present in this paper a linear-time algorithm for converting an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) representation of a propositional theory into an equivalent DNNF, showing that DNNFs scale as well as OBDDs. We also identify a subclass of DNNF which we call deterministic DNNF, d-DNNF, and show that the previous complexity guarantees on compiling DNNF continue to hold for this stricter subclass, which has stronger properties. In particular, we present a new operation on d-DNNF which allows us to count its models under the assertion, retraction and flipping of every literal by traversing the d-DNNF twice. That is, after such traversal, we can test in constant-time: the entailment of any literal by the d-DNNF, and the consistency of the d-DNNF under the retraction or flipping of any literal. We demonstrate the significance of these new operations by showing how they allow us to implement linear-time, complete truth maintenance systems and linear-time, complete belief revision systems for two important classes of propositional theories."
BDD-based reasoning in the fluent calculus - first results,2000-03-09T17:18:12Z,Hans-Peter Stoerr,"Steffen Hoelldobler, Hans-Peter Stoerr",cs.AI,The paper reports on first preliminary results and insights gained in a project aiming at implementing the fluent calculus using methods and techniques based on binary decision diagrams. After reporting on an initial experiment showing promising results we discuss our findings concerning various techniques and heuristics used to speed up the reasoning process.
Planning with Incomplete Information,2000-03-09T22:30:27Z,Francesca Toni,"Antonis Kakas, Rob Miller, Francesca Toni",cs.AI,"Planning is a natural domain of application for frameworks of reasoning about actions and change. In this paper we study how one such framework, the Language E, can form the basis for planning under (possibly) incomplete information. We define two types of plans: weak and safe plans, and propose a planner, called the E-Planner, which is often able to extend an initial weak plan into a safe plan even though the (explicit) information available is incomplete, e.g. for cases where the initial state is not completely known. The E-Planner is based upon a reformulation of the Language E in argumentation terms and a natural proof theory resulting from the reformulation. It uses an extension of this proof theory by means of abduction for the generation of plans and adopts argumentation-based techniques for extending weak plans into safe plans. We provide representative examples illustrating the behaviour of the E-Planner, in particular for cases where the status of fluents is incompletely known."
Local Diagnosis,2000-03-10T22:54:55Z,Renata Wassermann,Renata Wassermann,cs.AI,"In an earlier work, we have presented operations of belief change which only affect the relevant part of a belief base. In this paper, we propose the application of the same strategy to the problem of model-based diangosis. We first isolate the subset of the system description which is relevant for a given observation and then solve the diagnosis problem for this subset."
A Consistency-Based Model for Belief Change: Preliminary Report,2000-03-11T06:29:02Z,Torsten Schaub,"James Delgrande, Torsten Schaub",cs.AI,"We present a general, consistency-based framework for belief change. Informally, in revising K by A, we begin with A and incorporate as much of K as consistently possible. Formally, a knowledge base K and sentence A are expressed, via renaming propositions in K, in separate languages. Using a maximization process, we assume the languages are the same insofar as consistently possible. Lastly, we express the resultant knowledge base in a single language. There may be more than one way in which A can be so extended by K: in choice revision, one such ``extension'' represents the revised state; alternately revision consists of the intersection of all such extensions.   The most general formulation of our approach is flexible enough to express other approaches to revision and update, the merging of knowledge bases, and the incorporation of static and dynamic integrity constraints. Our framework differs from work based on ordinal conditional functions, notably with respect to iterated revision. We argue that the approach is well-suited for implementation: the choice revision operator gives better complexity results than general revision; the approach can be expressed in terms of a finite knowledge base; and the scope of a revision can be restricted to just those propositions mentioned in the sentence for revision A."
SATEN: An Object-Oriented Web-Based Revision and Extraction Engine,2000-03-14T04:58:18Z,Aidan Sims,"Mary-Anne Williams, Aidan Sims",cs.AI,SATEN is an object-oriented web-based extraction and belief revision engine. It runs on any computer via a Java 1.1 enabled browser such as Netscape 4. SATEN performs belief revision based on the AGM approach. The extraction and belief revision reasoning engines operate on a user specified ranking of information. One of the features of SATEN is that it can be used to integrate mutually inconsistent commensuate rankings into a consistent ranking.
dcs: An Implementation of DATALOG with Constraints,2000-03-14T18:06:38Z,Miroslaw Truszczynski,"Deborah East, Miroslaw Truszczynski",cs.AI,"Answer-set programming (ASP) has emerged recently as a viable programming paradigm. We describe here an ASP system, DATALOG with constraints or DC, based on non-monotonic logic. Informally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of Horn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of the propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the system, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the syntax, use and implementation of DC and provide experimental results."
DATALOG with constraints - an answer-set programming system,2000-03-24T19:09:59Z,Miroslaw Truszczynski,"Deborah East, Miroslaw Truszczynski",cs.AI,"Answer-set programming (ASP) has emerged recently as a viable programming paradigm well attuned to search problems in AI, constraint satisfaction and combinatorics. Propositional logic is, arguably, the simplest ASP system with an intuitive semantics supporting direct modeling of problem constraints. However, for some applications, especially those requiring that transitive closure be computed, it requires additional variables and results in large theories. Consequently, it may not be a practical computational tool for such problems. On the other hand, ASP systems based on nonmonotonic logics, such as stable logic programming, can handle transitive closure computation efficiently and, in general, yield very concise theories as problem representations. Their semantics is, however, more complex. Searching for the middle ground, in this paper we introduce a new nonmonotonic logic, DATALOG with constraints or DC. Informally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of Horn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of the propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the system, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the syntax and semantics of DC, and study its properties. We discuss an implementation of DC and present results of experimental study of the effectiveness of DC, comparing it with CSAT, a satisfiability checker and SMODELS implementation of stable logic programming. Our results show that DC is competitive with the other two approaches, in case of many search problems, often yielding much more efficient solutions."
Some Remarks on Boolean Constraint Propagation,2000-03-28T11:49:37Z,Krzysztof R. Apt,Krzysztof R. Apt,cs.AI,"We study here the well-known propagation rules for Boolean constraints. First we propose a simple notion of completeness for sets of such rules and establish a completeness result. Then we show an equivalence in an appropriate sense between Boolean constraint propagation and unit propagation, a form of resolution for propositional logic.   Subsequently we characterize one set of such rules by means of the notion of hyper-arc consistency introduced in (Mohr and Masini 1988). Also, we clarify the status of a similar, though different, set of rules introduced in (Simonis 1989a) and more fully in (Codognet and Diaz 1996)."
Conditional Plausibility Measures and Bayesian Networks,2000-05-30T19:05:21Z,Joseph Y. Halpern,Joseph Y. Halpern,cs.AI,"A general notion of algebraic conditional plausibility measures is defined. Probability measures, ranking functions, possibility measures, and (under the appropriate definitions) sets of probability measures can all be viewed as defining algebraic conditional plausibility measures. It is shown that algebraic conditional plausibility measures can be represented using Bayesian networks."
Constraint compiling into rules formalism constraint compiling into   rules formalism for dynamic CSPs computing,2000-06-30T10:25:06Z,J. Rodriguez,"S. Piechowiak, J. Rodriguez",cs.AI,In this paper we present a rule based formalism for filtering variables domains of constraints. This formalism is well adapted for solving dynamic CSP. We take diagnosis as an instance problem to illustrate the use of these rules. A diagnosis problem is seen like finding all the minimal sets of constraints to be relaxed in the constraint network that models the device to be diagnosed
Brainstorm/J: a Java Framework for Intelligent Agents,2000-07-04T16:31:40Z,Analia Amandi,"Alejandro Zunino, Analia Amandi",cs.AI,"Despite the effort of many researchers in the area of multi-agent systems (MAS) for designing and programming agents, a few years ago the research community began to take into account that common features among different MAS exists. Based on these common features, several tools have tackled the problem of agent development on specific application domains or specific types of agents. As a consequence, their scope is restricted to a subset of the huge application domain of MAS. In this paper we propose a generic infrastructure for programming agents whose name is Brainstorm/J. The infrastructure has been implemented as an object oriented framework. As a consequence, our approach supports a broader scope of MAS applications than previous efforts, being flexible and reusable."
On the relationship between fuzzy logic and four-valued relevance logic,2000-10-31T14:14:26Z,Umberto Straccia,Umberto Straccia,cs.AI,"In fuzzy propositional logic, to a proposition a partial truth in [0,1] is assigned. It is well known that under certain circumstances, fuzzy logic collapses to classical logic. In this paper, we will show that under dual conditions, fuzzy logic collapses to four-valued (relevance) logic, where propositions have truth-value true, false, unknown, or contradiction. As a consequence, fuzzy entailment may be considered as ``in between'' four-valued (relevance) entailment and classical entailment."

Logic Programming Approaches for Representing and Solving Constraint   Satisfaction Problems: A Comparison,2000-11-21T13:56:21Z,Marc Denecker,"Nikolay Pelov, Emmanuel De Mot, Marc Denecker",cs.AI,"Many logic programming based approaches can be used to describe and solve combinatorial search problems. On the one hand there is constraint logic programming which computes a solution as an answer substitution to a query containing the variables of the constraint satisfaction problem. On the other hand there are systems based on stable model semantics, abductive systems, and first order logic model generators which compute solutions as models of some theory. This paper compares these different approaches from the point of view of knowledge representation (how declarative are the programs) and from the point of view of performance (how good are they at solving typical problems)."
Multi-Channel Parallel Adaptation Theory for Rule Discovery,2001-05-11T14:17:42Z,Li Min Fu,Li Min Fu,cs.AI,"In this paper, we introduce a new machine learning theory based on multi-channel parallel adaptation for rule discovery. This theory is distinguished from the familiar parallel-distributed adaptation theory of neural networks in terms of channel-based convergence to the target rules. We show how to realize this theory in a learning system named CFRule. CFRule is a parallel weight-based model, but it departs from traditional neural computing in that its internal knowledge is comprehensible. Furthermore, when the model converges upon training, each channel converges to a target rule. The model adaptation rule is derived by multi-level parallel weight optimization based on gradient descent. Since, however, gradient descent only guarantees local optimization, a multi-channel regression-based optimization strategy is developed to effectively deal with this problem. Formally, we prove that the CFRule model can explicitly and precisely encode any given rule set. Also, we prove a property related to asynchronous parallel convergence, which is a critical element of the multi-channel parallel adaptation theory for rule learning. Thanks to the quantizability nature of the CFRule model, rules can be extracted completely and soundly via a threshold-based mechanism. Finally, the practical application of the theory is demonstrated in DNA promoter recognition and hepatitis prognosis prediction."
A Constraint-Driven System for Contract Assembly,2001-06-07T14:27:30Z,Marek Sergot,"Aspassia Daskalopulu, Marek Sergot",cs.AI,"We present an approach for modelling the structure and coarse content of legal documents with a view to providing automated support for the drafting of contracts and contract database retrieval. The approach is designed to be applicable where contract drafting is based on model-form contracts or on existing examples of a similar type. The main features of the approach are: (1) the representation addresses the structure and the interrelationships between the constituent parts of contracts, but not the text of the document itself; (2) the representation of documents is separated from the mechanisms that manipulate it; and (3) the drafting process is subject to a collection of explicitly stated constraints that govern the structure of the documents. We describe the representation of document instances and of 'generic documents', which are data structures used to drive the creation of new document instances, and we show extracts from a sample session to illustrate the features of a prototype system implemented in MacProlog."
Modelling Contractual Arguments,2001-06-07T14:40:04Z,Aspassia Daskalopulu,"Chris Reed, Aspassia Daskalopulu",cs.AI,"One influential approach to assessing the ""goodness"" of arguments is offered by the Pragma-Dialectical school (p-d) (Eemeren & Grootendorst 1992). This can be compared with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann & Thompson 1988), an approach that originates in discourse analysis. In p-d terms an argument is good if it avoids committing a fallacy, whereas in RST terms an argument is good if it is coherent. RST has been criticised (Snoeck Henkemans 1997) for providing only a partially functional account of argument, and similar criticisms have been raised in the Natural Language Generation (NLG) community-particularly by Moore & Pollack (1992)- with regards to its account of intentionality in text in general. Mann and Thompson themselves note that although RST can be successfully applied to a wide range of texts from diverse domains, it fails to characterise some types of text, most notably legal contracts. There is ongoing research in the Artificial Intelligence and Law community exploring the potential for providing electronic support to contract negotiators, focusing on long-term, complex engineering agreements (see for example Daskalopulu & Sergot 1997). This paper provides a brief introduction to RST and illustrates its shortcomings with respect to contractual text. An alternative approach for modelling argument structure is presented which not only caters for contractual text, but also overcomes the aforementioned limitations of RST."
Information Integration and Computational Logic,2001-06-11T20:00:04Z,Antonis Kakas,"Yannis Dimopoulos, Antonis Kakas",cs.AI,"Information Integration is a young and exciting field with enormous research and commercial significance in the new world of the Information Society. It stands at the crossroad of Databases and Artificial Intelligence requiring novel techniques that bring together different methods from these fields. Information from disparate heterogeneous sources often with no a-priori common schema needs to be synthesized in a flexible, transparent and intelligent way in order to respond to the demands of a query thus enabling a more informed decision by the user or application program. The field although relatively young has already found many practical applications particularly for integrating information over the World Wide Web. This paper gives a brief introduction of the field highlighting some of the main current and future research issues and application areas. It attempts to evaluate the current and potential role of Computational Logic in this and suggests some of the problems where logic-based techniques could be used."
Enhancing Constraint Propagation with Composition Operators,2001-07-02T08:08:39Z,Eric Monfroy,"Laurent Granvilliers, Eric Monfroy",cs.AI,"Constraint propagation is a general algorithmic approach for pruning the search space of a CSP. In a uniform way, K. R. Apt has defined a computation as an iteration of reduction functions over a domain. He has also demonstrated the need for integrating static properties of reduction functions (commutativity and semi-commutativity) to design specialized algorithms such as AC3 and DAC. We introduce here a set of operators for modeling compositions of reduction functions. Two of the major goals are to tackle parallel computations, and dynamic behaviours (such as slow convergence)."
On Properties of Update Sequences Based on Causal Rejection,2001-09-05T09:19:34Z,H. Tompits,"T. Eiter, M. Fink, G. Sabbatini, H. Tompits",cs.AI,"We consider an approach to update nonmonotonic knowledge bases represented as extended logic programs under answer set semantics. New information is incorporated into the current knowledge base subject to a causal rejection principle enforcing that, in case of conflicts, more recent rules are preferred and older rules are overridden. Such a rejection principle is also exploited in other approaches to update logic programs, e.g., in dynamic logic programming by Alferes et al. We give a thorough analysis of properties of our approach, to get a better understanding of the causal rejection principle. We review postulates for update and revision operators from the area of theory change and nonmonotonic reasoning, and some new properties are considered as well. We then consider refinements of our semantics which incorporate a notion of minimality of change. As well, we investigate the relationship to other approaches, showing that our approach is semantically equivalent to inheritance programs by Buccafurri et al. and that it coincides with certain classes of dynamic logic programs, for which we provide characterizations in terms of graph conditions. Therefore, most of our results about properties of causal rejection principle apply to these approaches as well. Finally, we deal with computational complexity of our approach, and outline how the update semantics and its refinements can be implemented on top of existing logic programming engines."
Gradient-based Reinforcement Planning in Policy-Search Methods,2001-11-28T13:43:13Z,Juergen Schmidhuber,"Ivo Kwee, Marcus Hutter, Juergen Schmidhuber",cs.AI,"We introduce a learning method called ``gradient-based reinforcement planning'' (GREP). Unlike traditional DP methods that improve their policy backwards in time, GREP is a gradient-based method that plans ahead and improves its policy before it actually acts in the environment. We derive formulas for the exact policy gradient that maximizes the expected future reward and confirm our ideas with numerical experiments."
Rational Competitive Analysis,2001-12-13T00:46:10Z,Moshe Tennenholtz,Moshe Tennenholtz,cs.AI,"Much work in computer science has adopted competitive analysis as a tool for decision making under uncertainty. In this work we extend competitive analysis to the context of multi-agent systems. Unlike classical competitive analysis where the behavior of an agent's environment is taken to be arbitrary, we consider the case where an agent's environment consists of other agents. These agents will usually obey some (minimal) rationality constraints. This leads to the definition of rational competitive analysis. We introduce the concept of rational competitive analysis, and initiate the study of competitive analysis for multi-agent systems. We also discuss the application of rational competitive analysis to the context of bidding games, as well as to the classical one-way trading problem."

"Nonmonotonic Reasoning, Preferential Models and Cumulative Logics",2002-02-18T10:29:54Z,Menachem Magidor,"Sarit Kraus, Daniel Lehmann, Menachem Magidor",cs.AI,"Many systems that exhibit nonmonotonic behavior have been described and studied already in the literature. The general notion of nonmonotonic reasoning, though, has almost always been described only negatively, by the property it does not enjoy, i.e. monotonicity. We study here general patterns of nonmonotonic reasoning and try to isolate properties that could help us map the field of nonmonotonic reasoning by reference to positive properties. We concentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic consequence relations, defined in the style of Gentzen. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points of view are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by D. Gabbay, while the latter has been advocated by Y. Shoham in. Five such families are defined and characterized by representation theorems, relating the two points of view. One of the families of interest, that of preferential relations, turns out to have been studied by E. Adams. The ""preferential"" models proposed here are a much stronger tool than Adams' probabilistic semantics. The basic language used in this paper is that of propositional logic. The extension of our results to first order predicate calculi and the study of the computational complexity of the decision problems described in this paper will be treated in another paper."
What does a conditional knowledge base entail?,2002-02-18T12:43:18Z,Menachem Magidor,"Daniel Lehmann, Menachem Magidor",cs.AI,"This paper presents a logical approach to nonmonotonic reasoning based on the notion of a nonmonotonic consequence relation. A conditional knowledge base, consisting of a set of conditional assertions of the type ""if ... then ..."", represents the explicit defeasible knowledge an agent has about the way the world generally behaves. We look for a plausible definition of the set of all conditional assertions entailed by a conditional knowledge base. In a previous paper, S. Kraus and the authors defined and studied ""preferential"" consequence relations. They noticed that not all preferential relations could be considered as reasonable inference procedures. This paper studies a more restricted class of consequence relations, ""rational"" relations. It is argued that any reasonable nonmonotonic inference procedure should define a rational relation. It is shown that the rational relations are exactly those that may be represented by a ""ranked"" preferential model, or by a (non-standard) probabilistic model. The rational closure of a conditional knowledge base is defined and shown to provide an attractive answer to the question of the title. Global properties of this closure operation are proved: it is a cumulative operation. It is also computationally tractable. This paper assumes the underlying language is propositional."

Distance Semantics for Belief Revision,2002-02-18T15:36:46Z,Karl Schlechta,"Daniel Lehmann, Menachem Magidor, Karl Schlechta",cs.AI,"A vast and interesting family of natural semantics for belief revision is defined. Suppose one is given a distance d between any two models. One may then define the revision of a theory K by a formula a as the theory defined by the set of all those models of a that are closest, by d, to the set of models of K. This family is characterized by a set of rationality postulates that extends the AGM postulates. The new postulates describe properties of iterated revisions."
Preferred History Semantics for Iterated Updates,2002-02-18T15:53:56Z,Karl Schlechta,"Shai Berger, Daniel Lehmann, Karl Schlechta",cs.AI,"We give a semantics to iterated update by a preference relation on possible developments. An iterated update is a sequence of formulas, giving (incomplete) information about successive states of the world. A development is a sequence of models, describing a possible trajectory through time. We assume a principle of inertia and prefer those developments, which are compatible with the information, and avoid unnecessary changes. The logical properties of the updates defined in this way are considered, and a representation result is proved."
Nonmonotonic inference operations,2002-02-20T14:19:42Z,Daniel Lehmann,"Michael Freund, Daniel Lehmann",cs.AI,"A. Tarski proposed the study of infinitary consequence operations as the central topic of mathematical logic. He considered monotonicity to be a property of all such operations. In this paper, we weaken the monotonicity requirement and consider more general operations, inference operations. These operations describe the nonmonotonic logics both humans and machines seem to be using when infering defeasible information from incomplete knowledge. We single out a number of interesting families of inference operations. This study of infinitary inference operations is inspired by the results of Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor on finitary nonmonotonic operations, but this paper is self-contained."
The logical meaning of Expansion,2002-02-20T14:50:49Z,Daniel Lehmann,Daniel Lehmann,cs.AI,"The Expansion property considered by researchers in Social Choice is shown to correspond to a logical property of nonmonotonic consequence relations that is the {\em pure}, i.e., not involving connectives, version of a previously known weak rationality condition. The assumption that the union of two definable sets of models is definable is needed for the soundness part of the result."
Another perspective on Default Reasoning,2002-03-01T11:06:49Z,Daniel Lehmann,Daniel Lehmann,cs.AI,"The lexicographic closure of any given finite set D of normal defaults is defined. A conditional assertion ""if a then b"" is in this lexicographic closure if, given the defaults D and the fact a, one would conclude b. The lexicographic closure is essentially a rational extension of D, and of its rational closure, defined in a previous paper. It provides a logic of normal defaults that is different from the one proposed by R. Reiter and that is rich enough not to require the consideration of non-normal defaults. A large number of examples are provided to show that the lexicographic closure corresponds to the basic intuitions behind Reiter's logic of defaults."
Deductive Nonmonotonic Inference Operations: Antitonic Representations,2002-03-01T11:20:59Z,Daniel Lehmann,"Yuri Kaluzhny, Daniel Lehmann",cs.AI,"We provide a characterization of those nonmonotonic inference operations C for which C(X) may be described as the set of all logical consequences of X together with some set of additional assumptions S(X) that depends anti-monotonically on X (i.e., X is a subset of Y implies that S(Y) is a subset of S(X)). The operations represented are exactly characterized in terms of properties most of which have been studied in Freund-Lehmann(cs.AI/0202031). Similar characterizations of right-absorbing and cumulative operations are also provided. For cumulative operations, our results fit in closely with those of Freund. We then discuss extending finitary operations to infinitary operations in a canonical way and discuss co-compactness properties. Our results provide a satisfactory notion of pseudo-compactness, generalizing to deductive nonmonotonic operations the notion of compactness for monotonic operations. They also provide an alternative, more elegant and more general, proof of the existence of an infinitary deductive extension for any finitary deductive operation (Theorem 7.9 of Freund-Lehmann)."
Stereotypical Reasoning: Logical Properties,2002-03-04T08:57:54Z,Daniel Lehmann,Daniel Lehmann,cs.AI,Stereotypical reasoning assumes that the situation at hand is one of a kind and that it enjoys the properties generally associated with that kind of situation. It is one of the most basic forms of nonmonotonic reasoning. A formal model for stereotypical reasoning is proposed and the logical properties of this form of reasoning are studied. Stereotypical reasoning is shown to be cumulative under weak assumptions.
A Framework for Compiling Preferences in Logic Programs,2002-03-04T13:00:41Z,H. Tompits,"J. P. Delgrande, T. Schaub, H. Tompits",cs.AI,"We introduce a methodology and framework for expressing general preference information in logic programming under the answer set semantics. An ordered logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form s < t where s and t are names. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original program. Our approach allows the specification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily within a program. Static orderings (in which preferences are external to a logic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. First, we develop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the preference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. We then demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing how other approaches, among them that of Brewka and Eiter, can be captured within our framework. Since the result of each of these transformations is an extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a publicly available compiler as a front-end for these programming systems."
Two results for proiritized logic programming,2002-03-05T00:28:04Z,Yan Zhang,Yan Zhang,cs.AI,"Prioritized default reasoning has illustrated its rich expressiveness and flexibility in knowledge representation and reasoning. However, many important aspects of prioritized default reasoning have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we investigate two properties of prioritized logic programs in the context of answer set semantics. Specifically, we reveal a close relationship between mutual defeasibility and uniqueness of the answer set for a prioritized logic program. We then explore how the splitting technique for extended logic programs can be extended to prioritized logic programs. We prove splitting theorems that can be used to simplify the evaluation of a prioritized logic program under certain conditions."
Belief Revision and Rational Inference,2002-04-14T09:22:42Z,Daniel Lehmann,"Michael Freund, Daniel Lehmann",cs.AI,"The (extended) AGM postulates for belief revision seem to deal with the revision of a given theory K by an arbitrary formula, but not to constrain the revisions of two different theories by the same formula. A new postulate is proposed and compared with other similar postulates that have been proposed in the literature. The AGM revisions that satisfy this new postulate stand in one-to-one correspondence with the rational, consistency-preserving relations. This correspondence is described explicitly. Two viewpoints on iterative revisions are distinguished and discussed."
Ultimate approximations in nonmonotonic knowledge representation systems,2002-05-11T20:44:16Z,Miroslaw Truszczynski,"Marc Denecker, Victor W. Marek, Miroslaw Truszczynski",cs.AI,"We study fixpoints of operators on lattices. To this end we introduce the notion of an approximation of an operator. We order approximations by means of a precision ordering. We show that each lattice operator O has a unique most precise or ultimate approximation. We demonstrate that fixpoints of this ultimate approximation provide useful insights into fixpoints of the operator O.   We apply our theory to logic programming and introduce the ultimate Kripke-Kleene, well-founded and stable semantics. We show that the ultimate Kripke-Kleene and well-founded semantics are more precise then their standard counterparts We argue that ultimate semantics for logic programming have attractive epistemological properties and that, while in general they are computationally more complex than the standard semantics, for many classes of theories, their complexity is no worse."
Handling Defeasibilities in Action Domains,2002-06-03T06:20:21Z,Yan Zhang,Yan Zhang,cs.AI,"Representing defeasibility is an important issue in common sense reasoning. In reasoning about action and change, this issue becomes more difficult because domain and action related defeasible information may conflict with general inertia rules. Furthermore, different types of defeasible information may also interfere with each other during the reasoning. In this paper, we develop a prioritized logic programming approach to handle defeasibilities in reasoning about action. In particular, we propose three action languages {\cal AT}^{0}, {\cal AT}^{1} and {\cal AT}^{2} which handle three types of defeasibilities in action domains named defeasible constraints, defeasible observations and actions with defeasible and abnormal effects respectively. Each language with a higher superscript can be viewed as an extension of the language with a lower superscript. These action languages inherit the simple syntax of {\cal A} language but their semantics is developed in terms of transition systems where transition functions are defined based on prioritized logic programs. By illustrating various examples, we show that our approach eventually provides a powerful mechanism to handle various defeasibilities in temporal prediction and postdiction. We also investigate semantic properties of these three action languages and characterize classes of action domains that present more desirable solutions in reasoning about action within the underlying action languages."
Anticipatory Guidance of Plot,2002-06-26T09:17:13Z,Magnus Boman,"Jarmo Laaksolahti, Magnus Boman",cs.AI,"An anticipatory system for guiding plot development in interactive narratives is described. The executable model is a finite automaton that provides the implemented system with a look-ahead. The identification of undesirable future states in the model is used to guide the player, in a transparent manner. In this way, too radical twists of the plot can be avoided. Since the player participates in the development of the plot, such guidance can have many forms, depending on the environment of the player, on the behavior of the other players, and on the means of player interaction. We present a design method for interactive narratives which produces designs suitable for the implementation of anticipatory mechanisms. Use of the method is illustrated by application to our interactive computer game Kaktus."
"Abduction, ASP and Open Logic Programs",2002-07-07T09:55:00Z,Piero A. Bonatti,Piero A. Bonatti,cs.AI,"Open logic programs and open entailment have been recently proposed as an abstract framework for the verification of incomplete specifications based upon normal logic programs and the stable model semantics. There are obvious analogies between open predicates and abducible predicates. However, despite superficial similarities, there are features of open programs that have no immediate counterpart in the framework of abduction and viceversa. Similarly, open programs cannot be immediately simulated with answer set programming (ASP). In this paper we start a thorough investigation of the relationships between open inference, abduction and ASP. We shall prove that open programs generalize the other two frameworks. The generalized framework suggests interesting extensions of abduction under the generalized stable model semantics. In some cases, we will be able to reduce open inference to abduction and ASP, thereby estimating its computational complexity. At the same time, the aforementioned reduction opens the way to new applications of abduction and ASP."
Domain-Dependent Knowledge in Answer Set Planning,2002-07-08T00:31:54Z,Sheila McIlraith,"Tran Cao Son, Chitta Baral, Nam Tran, Sheila McIlraith",cs.AI,"In this paper we consider three different kinds of domain-dependent control knowledge (temporal, procedural and HTN-based) that are useful in planning. Our approach is declarative and relies on the language of logic programming with answer set semantics (AnsProlog*). AnsProlog* is designed to plan without control knowledge. We show how temporal, procedural and HTN-based control knowledge can be incorporated into AnsProlog* by the modular addition of a small number of domain-dependent rules, without the need to modify the planner. We formally prove the correctness of our planner, both in the absence and presence of the control knowledge. Finally, we perform some initial experimentation that demonstrates the potential reduction in planning time that can be achieved when procedural domain knowledge is used to solve planning problems with large plan length."
"""Minimal defence"": a refinement of the preferred semantics for   argumentation frameworks",2002-07-08T13:30:16Z,J. Mengin,"C. Cayrol, S. Doutre, M. -C. Lagasquie-Schiex, J. Mengin",cs.AI,"Dung's abstract framework for argumentation enables a study of the interactions between arguments based solely on an ``attack'' binary relation on the set of arguments. Various ways to solve conflicts between contradictory pieces of information have been proposed in the context of argumentation, nonmonotonic reasoning or logic programming, and can be captured by appropriate semantics within Dung's framework. A common feature of these semantics is that one can always maximize in some sense the set of acceptable arguments. We propose in this paper to extend Dung's framework in order to allow for the representation of what we call ``restricted'' arguments: these arguments should only be used if absolutely necessary, that is, in order to support other arguments that would otherwise be defeated. We modify Dung's preferred semantics accordingly: a set of arguments becomes acceptable only if it contains a minimum of restricted arguments, for a maximum of unrestricted arguments."
Two Representations for Iterative Non-prioritized Change,2002-07-09T12:32:45Z,Alexander Bochman,Alexander Bochman,cs.AI,"We address a general representation problem for belief change, and describe two interrelated representations for iterative non-prioritized change: a logical representation in terms of persistent epistemic states, and a constructive representation in terms of flocks of bases."
Collective Argumentation,2002-07-09T12:42:24Z,Alexander Bochman,Alexander Bochman,cs.AI,"An extension of an abstract argumentation framework, called collective argumentation, is introduced in which the attack relation is defined directly among sets of arguments. The extension turns out to be suitable, in particular, for representing semantics of disjunctive logic programs. Two special kinds of collective argumentation are considered in which the opponents can share their arguments."
Logic Programming with Ordered Disjunction,2002-07-11T11:03:34Z,Gerhard Brewka,Gerhard Brewka,cs.AI,"Logic programs with ordered disjunction (LPODs) combine ideas underlying Qualitative Choice Logic (Brewka et al. KR 2002) and answer set programming. Logic programming under answer set semantics is extended with a new connective called ordered disjunction. The new connective allows us to represent alternative, ranked options for problem solutions in the heads of rules: A \times B intuitively means: if possible A, but if A is not possible then at least B. The semantics of logic programs with ordered disjunction is based on a preference relation on answer sets. LPODs are useful for applications in design and configuration and can serve as a basis for qualitative decision making."
Compilation of Propositional Weighted Bases,2002-07-11T16:11:40Z,Pierre Marquis,"Adnan Darwiche, Pierre Marquis",cs.AI,"In this paper, we investigate the extent to which knowledge compilation can be used to improve inference from propositional weighted bases. We present a general notion of compilation of a weighted base that is parametrized by any equivalence--preserving compilation function. Both negative and positive results are presented. On the one hand, complexity results are identified, showing that the inference problem from a compiled weighted base is as difficult as in the general case, when the prime implicates, Horn cover or renamable Horn cover classes are targeted. On the other hand, we show that the inference problem becomes tractable whenever DNNF-compilations are used and clausal queries are considered. Moreover, we show that the set of all preferred models of a DNNF-compilation of a weighted base can be computed in time polynomial in the output size. Finally, we sketch how our results can be used in model-based diagnosis in order to compute the most probable diagnoses of a system."
Modeling Complex Domains of Actions and Change,2002-07-13T12:00:16Z,Loizos Michael,"Antonis Kakas, Loizos Michael",cs.AI,"This paper studies the problem of modeling complex domains of actions and change within high-level action description languages. We investigate two main issues of concern: (a) can we represent complex domains that capture together different problems such as ramifications, non-determinism and concurrency of actions, at a high-level, close to the given natural ontology of the problem domain and (b) what features of such a representation can affect, and how, its computational behaviour. The paper describes the main problems faced in this representation task and presents the results of an empirical study, carried out through a series of controlled experiments, to analyze the computational performance of reasoning in these representations. The experiments compare different representations obtained, for example, by changing the basic ontology of the domain or by varying the degree of use of indirect effect laws through domain constraints. This study has helped to expose the main sources of computational difficulty in the reasoning and suggest some methodological guidelines for representing complex domains. Although our work has been carried out within one particular high-level description language, we believe that the results, especially those that relate to the problems of representation, are independent of the specific modeling language."

Preferred well-founded semantics for logic programming by alternating   fixpoints: Preliminary report,2002-07-15T13:30:24Z,Kewen Wang,"Torsten Schaub, Kewen Wang",cs.AI,"We analyze the problem of defining well-founded semantics for ordered logic programs within a general framework based on alternating fixpoint theory. We start by showing that generalizations of existing answer set approaches to preference are too weak in the setting of well-founded semantics. We then specify some informal yet intuitive criteria and propose a semantical framework for preference handling that is more suitable for defining well-founded semantics for ordered logic programs. The suitability of the new approach is convinced by the fact that many attractive properties are satisfied by our semantics. In particular, our semantics is still correct with respect to various existing answer sets semantics while it successfully overcomes the weakness of their generalization to well-founded semantics. Finally, we indicate how an existing preferred well-founded semantics can be captured within our semantical framework."
Embedding Default Logic in Propositional Argumentation Systems,2002-07-16T15:16:07Z,Juerg Kohlas,"Dritan Berzati, Bernhard Anrig, Juerg Kohlas",cs.AI,"In this paper we present a transformation of finite propositional default theories into so-called propositional argumentation systems. This transformation allows to characterize all notions of Reiter's default logic in the framework of argumentation systems. As a consequence, computing extensions, or determining wether a given formula belongs to one extension or all extensions can be answered without leaving the field of classical propositional logic. The transformation proposed is linear in the number of defaults."
On the existence and multiplicity of extensions in dialectical   argumentation,2002-07-17T12:09:45Z,Bart Verheij,Bart Verheij,cs.AI,"In the present paper, the existence and multiplicity problems of extensions are addressed. The focus is on extension of the stable type. The main result of the paper is an elegant characterization of the existence and multiplicity of extensions in terms of the notion of dialectical justification, a close cousin of the notion of admissibility. The characterization is given in the context of the particular logic for dialectical argumentation DEFLOG. The results are of direct relevance for several well-established models of defeasible reasoning (like default logic, logic programming and argumentation frameworks), since elsewhere dialectical argumentation has been shown to have close formal connections with these models."
Nonmonotonic Probabilistic Logics between Model-Theoretic Probabilistic   Logic and Probabilistic Logic under Coherence,2002-07-22T01:44:25Z,Thomas Lukasiewicz,Thomas Lukasiewicz,cs.AI,"Recently, it has been shown that probabilistic entailment under coherence is weaker than model-theoretic probabilistic entailment. Moreover, probabilistic entailment under coherence is a generalization of default entailment in System P. In this paper, we continue this line of research by presenting probabilistic generalizations of more sophisticated notions of classical default entailment that lie between model-theoretic probabilistic entailment and probabilistic entailment under coherence. That is, the new formalisms properly generalize their counterparts in classical default reasoning, they are weaker than model-theoretic probabilistic entailment, and they are stronger than probabilistic entailment under coherence. The new formalisms are useful especially for handling probabilistic inconsistencies related to conditioning on zero events. They can also be applied for probabilistic belief revision. More generally, in the same spirit as a similar previous paper, this paper sheds light on exciting new formalisms for probabilistic reasoning beyond the well-known standard ones."
Evaluating Defaults,2002-07-24T23:05:29Z,Choh Man Teng,"Henry E. Kyburg Jr., Choh Man Teng",cs.AI,"We seek to find normative criteria of adequacy for nonmonotonic logic similar to the criterion of validity for deductive logic. Rather than stipulating that the conclusion of an inference be true in all models in which the premises are true, we require that the conclusion of a nonmonotonic inference be true in ``almost all'' models of a certain sort in which the premises are true. This ``certain sort'' specification picks out the models that are relevant to the inference, taking into account factors such as specificity and vagueness, and previous inferences. The frequencies characterizing the relevant models reflect known frequencies in our actual world. The criteria of adequacy for a default inference can be extended by thresholding to criteria of adequacy for an extension. We show that this avoids the implausibilities that might otherwise result from the chaining of default inferences. The model proportions, when construed in terms of frequencies, provide a verifiable grounding of default rules, and can become the basis for generating default rules from statistics."
Linking Makinson and Kraus-Lehmann-Magidor preferential entailments,2002-08-08T17:08:46Z,Yves Moinard,Yves Moinard,cs.AI,"About ten years ago, various notions of preferential entailment have been introduced. The main reference is a paper by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor (KLM), one of the main competitor being a more general version defined by Makinson (MAK). These two versions have already been compared, but it is time to revisit these comparisons. Here are our three main results: (1) These two notions are equivalent, provided that we restrict our attention, as done in KLM, to the cases where the entailment respects logical equivalence (on the left and on the right). (2) A serious simplification of the description of the fundamental cases in which MAK is equivalent to KLM, including a natural passage in both ways. (3) The two previous results are given for preferential entailments more general than considered in some of the original texts, but they apply also to the original definitions and, for this particular case also, the models can be simplified."

Causes and Explanations: A Structural-Model Approach. Part II:   Explanations,2002-08-20T23:08:49Z,Judea Pearl,"Joseph Y. Halpern, Judea Pearl",cs.AI,"We propose new definitions of (causal) explanation, using structural equations to model counterfactuals. The definition is based on the notion of actual cause, as defined and motivated in a companion paper. Essentially, an explanation is a fact that is not known for certain but, if found to be true, would constitute an actual cause of the fact to be explained, regardless of the agent's initial uncertainty. We show that the definition handles well a number of problematic examples from the literature."
Reasoning about Evolving Nonmonotonic Knowledge Bases,2002-09-16T19:23:19Z,H. Tompits,"T. Eiter, M. Fink, G. Sabbatini, H. Tompits",cs.AI,"Recently, several approaches to updating knowledge bases modeled as extended logic programs have been introduced, ranging from basic methods to incorporate (sequences of) sets of rules into a logic program, to more elaborate methods which use an update policy for specifying how updates must be incorporated. In this paper, we introduce a framework for reasoning about evolving knowledge bases, which are represented as extended logic programs and maintained by an update policy. We first describe a formal model which captures various update approaches, and we define a logical language for expressing properties of evolving knowledge bases. We then investigate semantical and computational properties of our framework, where we focus on properties of knowledge states with respect to the canonical reasoning task of whether a given formula holds on a given evolving knowledge base. In particular, we present finitary characterizations of the evolution for certain classes of framework instances, which can be exploited for obtaining decidability results. In more detail, we characterize the complexity of reasoning for some meaningful classes of evolving knowledge bases, ranging from polynomial to double exponential space complexity."
"A Comparison of Different Cognitive Paradigms Using Simple Animats in a   Virtual Laboratory, with Implications to the Notion of Cognition",2002-09-19T16:35:55Z,Carlos Gershenson,Carlos Gershenson,cs.AI,"In this thesis I present a virtual laboratory which implements five different models for controlling animats: a rule-based system, a behaviour-based system, a concept-based system, a neural network, and a Braitenberg architecture. Through different experiments, I compare the performance of the models and conclude that there is no ""best"" model, since different models are better for different things in different contexts.   The models I chose, although quite simple, represent different approaches for studying cognition. Using the results as an empirical philosophical aid,   I note that there is no ""best"" approach for studying cognition, since different approaches have all advantages and disadvantages, because they study different aspects of cognition from different contexts. This has implications for current debates on ""proper"" approaches for cognition: all approaches are a bit proper, but none will be ""proper enough"". I draw remarks on the notion of cognition abstracting from all the approaches used to study it, and propose a simple classification for different types of cognition."
Revising Partially Ordered Beliefs,2002-10-03T09:29:54Z,Odile Papini,"Salem Benferhat, Sylvain Lagrue, Odile Papini",cs.AI,"This paper deals with the revision of partially ordered beliefs. It proposes a semantic representation of epistemic states by partial pre-orders on interpretations and a syntactic representation by partially ordered belief bases. Two revision operations, the revision stemming from the history of observations and the possibilistic revision, defined when the epistemic state is represented by a total pre-order, are generalized, at a semantic level, to the case of a partial pre-order on interpretations, and at a syntactic level, to the case of a partially ordered belief base. The equivalence between the two representations is shown for the two revision operations."
"Can the whole brain be simpler than its ""parts""?",2002-11-09T17:16:18Z,Victor Eliashberg,Victor Eliashberg,cs.AI,"This is the first in a series of connected papers discussing the problem of a dynamically reconfigurable universal learning neurocomputer that could serve as a computational model for the whole human brain. The whole series is entitled ""The Brain Zero Project. My Brain as a Dynamically Reconfigurable Universal Learning Neurocomputer."" (For more information visit the website www.brain0.com.) This introductory paper is concerned with general methodology. Its main goal is to explain why it is critically important for both neural modeling and cognitive modeling to pay much attention to the basic requirements of the whole brain as a complex computing system. The author argues that it can be easier to develop an adequate computational model for the whole ""unprogrammed"" (untrained) human brain than to find adequate formal representations of some nontrivial parts of brain's performance. (In the same way as, for example, it is easier to describe the behavior of a complex analytical function than the behavior of its real and/or imaginary part.) The ""curse of dimensionality"" that plagues purely phenomenological (""brainless"") cognitive theories is a natural penalty for an attempt to represent insufficiently large parts of brain's performance in a state space of insufficiently high dimensionality. A ""partial"" modeler encounters ""Catch 22."" An attempt to simplify a cognitive problem by artificially reducing its dimensionality makes the problem more difficult."
Adaptive Development of Koncepts in Virtual Animats: Insights into the   Development of Knowledge,2002-11-21T18:13:31Z,Carlos Gershenson,Carlos Gershenson,cs.AI,"As a part of our effort for studying the evolution and development of cognition, we present results derived from synthetic experimentations in a virtual laboratory where animats develop koncepts adaptively and ground their meaning through action. We introduce the term ""koncept"" to avoid confusions and ambiguity derived from the wide use of the word ""concept"". We present the models which our animats use for abstracting koncepts from perceptions, plastically adapt koncepts, and associate koncepts with actions. On a more philosophical vein, we suggest that knowledge is a property of a cognitive system, not an element, and therefore observer-dependent."

Searching for Plannable Domains can Speed up Reinforcement Learning,2002-12-10T22:15:25Z,Andras Lorincz,"Istvan Szita, Balint Takacs, Andras Lorincz",cs.AI,"Reinforcement learning (RL) involves sequential decision making in uncertain environments. The aim of the decision-making agent is to maximize the benefit of acting in its environment over an extended period of time. Finding an optimal policy in RL may be very slow. To speed up learning, one often used solution is the integration of planning, for example, Sutton's Dyna algorithm, or various other methods using macro-actions.   Here we suggest to separate plannable, i.e., close to deterministic parts of the world, and focus planning efforts in this domain. A novel reinforcement learning method called plannable RL (pRL) is proposed here. pRL builds a simple model, which is used to search for macro actions. The simplicity of the model makes planning computationally inexpensive. It is shown that pRL finds an optimal policy, and that plannable macro actions found by pRL are near-optimal. In turn, it is unnecessary to try large numbers of macro actions, which enables fast learning. The utility of pRL is demonstrated by computer simulations."
Temporal plannability by variance of the episode length,2003-01-09T12:39:03Z,Andras Lorincz,"Balint Takacs, Istvan Szita, Andras Lorincz",cs.AI,"Optimization of decision problems in stochastic environments is usually concerned with maximizing the probability of achieving the goal and minimizing the expected episode length. For interacting agents in time-critical applications, learning of the possibility of scheduling of subtasks (events) or the full task is an additional relevant issue. Besides, there exist highly stochastic problems where the actual trajectories show great variety from episode to episode, but completing the task takes almost the same amount of time. The identification of sub-problems of this nature may promote e.g., planning, scheduling and segmenting Markov decision processes. In this work, formulae for the average duration as well as the standard deviation of the duration of events are derived. The emerging Bellman-type equation is a simple extension of Sobel's work (1982). Methods of dynamic programming as well as methods of reinforcement learning can be applied for our extension. Computer demonstration on a toy problem serve to highlight the principle."
Comparisons and Computation of Well-founded Semantics for Disjunctive   Logic Programs,2003-01-14T08:14:43Z,Lizhu Zhou,"Kewen Wang, Lizhu Zhou",cs.AI,"Much work has been done on extending the well-founded semantics to general disjunctive logic programs and various approaches have been proposed. However, these semantics are different from each other and no consensus is reached about which semantics is the most intended. In this paper we look at disjunctive well-founded reasoning from different angles. We show that there is an intuitive form of the well-founded reasoning in disjunctive logic programming which can be characterized by slightly modifying some exisitng approaches to defining disjunctive well-founded semantics, including program transformations, argumentation, unfounded sets (and resolution-like procedure). We also provide a bottom-up procedure for this semantics. The significance of our work is not only in clarifying the relationship among different approaches, but also shed some light on what is an intended well-founded semantics for disjunctive logic programs."
A semantic framework for preference handling in answer set programming,2003-01-23T09:09:31Z,Kewen Wang,"Torsten Schaub, Kewen Wang",cs.AI,"We provide a semantic framework for preference handling in answer set programming. To this end, we introduce preference preserving consequence operators. The resulting fixpoint characterizations provide us with a uniform semantic framework for characterizing preference handling in existing approaches. Although our approach is extensible to other semantics by means of an alternating fixpoint theory, we focus here on the elaboration of preferences under answer set semantics. Alternatively, we show how these approaches can be characterized by the concept of order preservation. These uniform semantic characterizations provide us with new insights about interrelationships and moreover about ways of implementation."
Defeasible Logic Programming: An Argumentative Approach,2003-02-20T00:48:06Z,Guillermo Ricardo Simari,"Alejandro Javier Garcia, Guillermo Ricardo Simari",cs.AI,"The work reported here introduces Defeasible Logic Programming (DeLP), a formalism that combines results of Logic Programming and Defeasible Argumentation. DeLP provides the possibility of representing information in the form of weak rules in a declarative manner, and a defeasible argumentation inference mechanism for warranting the entailed conclusions.   In DeLP an argumentation formalism will be used for deciding between contradictory goals. Queries will be supported by arguments that could be defeated by other arguments. A query q will succeed when there is an argument A for q that is warranted, ie, the argument A that supports q is found undefeated by a warrant procedure that implements a dialectical analysis.   The defeasible argumentation basis of DeLP allows to build applications that deal with incomplete and contradictory information in dynamic domains. Thus, the resulting approach is suitable for representing agent's knowledge and for providing an argumentation based reasoning mechanism to agents."
Constraint-based analysis of composite solvers,2003-02-25T14:33:08Z,Eric Monfroy,"Evgueni Petrov, Eric Monfroy",cs.AI,Cooperative constraint solving is an area of constraint programming that studies the interaction between constraint solvers with the aim of discovering the interaction patterns that amplify the positive qualities of individual solvers. Automatisation and formalisation of such studies is an important issue of cooperative constraint solving.   In this paper we present a constraint-based analysis of composite solvers that integrates reasoning about the individual solvers and the processed data. The idea is to approximate this reasoning by resolution of set constraints on the finite sets representing the predicates that express all the necessary properties. We illustrate application of our analysis to two important cooperation patterns: deterministic choice and loop.
Kalman-filtering using local interactions,2003-02-28T18:32:26Z,Andras Lorincz,"Barnabas Poczos, Andras Lorincz",cs.AI,"There is a growing interest in using Kalman-filter models for brain modelling. In turn, it is of considerable importance to represent Kalman-filter in connectionist forms with local Hebbian learning rules. To our best knowledge, Kalman-filter has not been given such local representation. It seems that the main obstacle is the dynamic adaptation of the Kalman-gain. Here, a connectionist representation is presented, which is derived by means of the recursive prediction error method. We show that this method gives rise to attractive local learning rules and can adapt the Kalman-gain."
On the Notion of Cognition,2003-03-10T18:20:28Z,Carlos Gershenson,Carlos Gershenson,cs.AI,"We discuss philosophical issues concerning the notion of cognition basing ourselves in experimental results in cognitive sciences, especially in computer simulations of cognitive systems. There have been debates on the ""proper"" approach for studying cognition, but we have realized that all approaches can be in theory equivalent. Different approaches model different properties of cognitive systems from different perspectives, so we can only learn from all of them. We also integrate ideas from several perspectives for enhancing the notion of cognition, such that it can contain other definitions of cognition as special cases. This allows us to propose a simple classification of different types of cognition."
Unfolding Partiality and Disjunctions in Stable Model Semantics,2003-03-14T14:29:32Z,J. You,"T. Janhunen, I. Niemela, D. Seipel, P. Simons, J. You",cs.AI,"The paper studies an implementation methodology for partial and disjunctive stable models where partiality and disjunctions are unfolded from a logic program so that an implementation of stable models for normal (disjunction-free) programs can be used as the core inference engine. The unfolding is done in two separate steps. Firstly, it is shown that partial stable models can be captured by total stable models using a simple linear and modular program transformation. Hence, reasoning tasks concerning partial stable models can be solved using an implementation of total stable models. Disjunctive partial stable models have been lacking implementations which now become available as the translation handles also the disjunctive case. Secondly, it is shown how total stable models of disjunctive programs can be determined by computing stable models for normal programs. Hence, an implementation of stable models of normal programs can be used as a core engine for implementing disjunctive programs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by constructing a system for computing stable models of disjunctive programs using the smodels system as the core engine. The performance of the resulting system is compared to that of dlv which is a state-of-the-art special purpose system for disjunctive programs."
Multi-target particle filtering for the probability hypothesis density,2003-03-20T13:48:04Z,Hedvig Sidenbladh,Hedvig Sidenbladh,cs.AI,"When tracking a large number of targets, it is often computationally expensive to represent the full joint distribution over target states. In cases where the targets move independently, each target can instead be tracked with a separate filter. However, this leads to a model-data association problem. Another approach to solve the problem with computational complexity is to track only the first moment of the joint distribution, the probability hypothesis density (PHD). The integral of this distribution over any area S is the expected number of targets within S. Since no record of object identity is kept, the model-data association problem is avoided.   The contribution of this paper is a particle filter implementation of the PHD filter mentioned above. This PHD particle filter is applied to tracking of multiple vehicles in terrain, a non-linear tracking problem. Experiments show that the filter can track a changing number of vehicles robustly, achieving near-real-time performance."
A Framework for Searching AND/OR Graphs with Cycles,2003-05-01T04:48:29Z,Samir K. Sadhukhan,"Ambuj Mahanti, Supriyo Ghose, Samir K. Sadhukhan",cs.AI,"Search in cyclic AND/OR graphs was traditionally known to be an unsolved problem. In the recent past several important studies have been reported in this domain. In this paper, we have taken a fresh look at the problem. First, a new and comprehensive theoretical framework for cyclic AND/OR graphs has been presented, which was found missing in the recent literature. Based on this framework, two best-first search algorithms, S1 and S2, have been developed. S1 does uninformed search and is a simple modification of the Bottom-up algorithm by Martelli and Montanari. S2 performs a heuristically guided search and replicates the modification in Bottom-up's successors, namely HS and AO*. Both S1 and S2 solve the problem of searching AND/OR graphs in presence of cycles. We then present a detailed analysis for the correctness and complexity results of S1 and S2, using the proposed framework. We have observed through experiments that S1 and S2 output correct results in all cases."

However, to find the preferred choice when the expected utility interval of one choice is included in that of another, it is necessary to interpolate a discerning point in the intervals. This is done by the parameter rho, defined as the probability that the ambiguity about the utility of every nonsingleton focal element will turn out as favorable as possible. If there are several different decision makers, we might sometimes be more interested in having the highest expected utility among the decision makers rather than only trying to maximize our own expected utility regardless of choices made by other decision makers. The preference of each choice is then determined by the probability of yielding the highest expected utility. This probability is equal to the maximal interval length of rho under which an alternative is preferred. We must here take into account not only the choices already made by other decision makers but also the rational choices we can assume to be made by later decision makers. In Strats apparatus, an assumption, unwarranted by the evidence at hand, has to be made about the value of rho. We demonstrate that no such assumption is necessary. It is sufficient to assume a uniform probability distribution for rho to be able to discern the most preferable choice. We discuss when this approach is justifiable."
Updating beliefs with incomplete observations,2003-05-27T11:05:52Z,Marco Zaffalon,"Gert de Cooman, Marco Zaffalon",cs.AI,"Currently, there is renewed interest in the problem, raised by Shafer in 1985, of updating probabilities when observations are incomplete. This is a fundamental problem in general, and of particular interest for Bayesian networks. Recently, Grunwald and Halpern have shown that commonly used updating strategies fail in this case, except under very special assumptions. In this paper we propose a new method for updating probabilities with incomplete observations. Our approach is deliberately conservative: we make no assumptions about the so-called incompleteness mechanism that associates complete with incomplete observations. We model our ignorance about this mechanism by a vacuous lower prevision, a tool from the theory of imprecise probabilities, and we use only coherence arguments to turn prior into posterior probabilities. In general, this new approach to updating produces lower and upper posterior probabilities and expectations, as well as partially determinate decisions. This is a logical consequence of the existing ignorance about the incompleteness mechanism. We apply the new approach to the problem of classification of new evidence in probabilistic expert systems, where it leads to a new, so-called conservative updating rule. In the special case of Bayesian networks constructed using expert knowledge, we provide an exact algorithm for classification based on our updating rule, which has linear-time complexity for a class of networks wider than polytrees. This result is then extended to the more general framework of credal networks, where computations are often much harder than with Bayesian nets. Using an example, we show that our rule appears to provide a solid basis for reliable updating with incomplete observations, when no strong assumptions about the incompleteness mechanism are justified."
Updating Probabilities,2003-06-23T22:24:05Z,Joseph Y. Halpern,"Peter D. Grunwald, Joseph Y. Halpern",cs.AI,"As examples such as the Monty Hall puzzle show, applying conditioning to update a probability distribution on a ``naive space'', which does not take into account the protocol used, can often lead to counterintuitive results. Here we examine why. A criterion known as CAR (``coarsening at random'') in the statistical literature characterizes when ``naive'' conditioning in a naive space works. We show that the CAR condition holds rather infrequently, and we provide a procedural characterization of it, by giving a randomized algorithm that generates all and only distributions for which CAR holds. This substantially extends previous characterizations of CAR. We also consider more generalized notions of update such as Jeffrey conditioning and minimizing relative entropy (MRE). We give a generalization of the CAR condition that characterizes when Jeffrey conditioning leads to appropriate answers, and show that there exist some very simple settings in which MRE essentially never gives the right results. This generalizes and interconnects previous results obtained in the literature on CAR and MRE."
Pruning Isomorphic Structural Sub-problems in Configuration,2003-06-27T11:25:17Z,Nicolas Prcovic,"Stephane Grandcolas, Laurent Henocque, Nicolas Prcovic",cs.AI,"Configuring consists in simulating the realization of a complex product from a catalog of component parts, using known relations between types, and picking values for object attributes. This highly combinatorial problem in the field of constraint programming has been addressed with a variety of approaches since the foundation system R1(McDermott82). An inherent difficulty in solving configuration problems is the existence of many isomorphisms among interpretations. We describe a formalism independent approach to improve the detection of isomorphisms by configurators, which does not require to adapt the problem model. To achieve this, we exploit the properties of a characteristic subset of configuration problems, called the structural sub-problem, which canonical solutions can be produced or tested at a limited cost. In this paper we present an algorithm for testing the canonicity of configurations, that can be added as a symmetry breaking constraint to any configurator. The cost and efficiency of this canonicity test are given."
"Probabilistic Reasoning as Information Compression by Multiple   Alignment, Unification and Search: An Introduction and Overview",2003-07-04T16:34:45Z,J Gerard Wolff,J Gerard Wolff,cs.AI,"This article introduces the idea that probabilistic reasoning (PR) may be understood as ""information compression by multiple alignment, unification and search"" (ICMAUS). In this context, multiple alignment has a meaning which is similar to but distinct from its meaning in bio-informatics, while unification means a simple merging of matching patterns, a meaning which is related to but simpler than the meaning of that term in logic.   A software model, SP61, has been developed for the discovery and formation of 'good' multiple alignments, evaluated in terms of information compression. The model is described in outline.   Using examples from the SP61 model, this article describes in outline how the ICMAUS framework can model various kinds of PR including: PR in best-match pattern recognition and information retrieval; one-step 'deductive' and 'abductive' PR; inheritance of attributes in a class hierarchy; chains of reasoning (probabilistic decision networks and decision trees, and PR with 'rules'); geometric analogy problems; nonmonotonic reasoning and reasoning with default values; modelling the function of a Bayesian network."

The ICMAUS concepts are described together with an outline of the SP61 software model in which the ICMAUS concepts are currently realised. A range of examples is presented, illustrated with output from the SP61 model."
Integrating cardinal direction relations and other orientation relations   in Qualitative Spatial Reasoning,2003-07-21T13:03:19Z,Amar Isli,Amar Isli,cs.AI,"We propose a calculus integrating two calculi well-known in Qualitative Spatial Reasoning (QSR): Frank's projection-based cardinal direction calculus, and a coarser version of Freksa's relative orientation calculus. An original constraint propagation procedure is presented, which implements the interaction between the two integrated calculi. The importance of taking into account the interaction is shown with a real example providing an inconsistent knowledge base, whose inconsistency (a) cannot be detected by reasoning separately about each of the two components of the knowledge, just because, taken separately, each is consistent, but (b) is detected by the proposed algorithm, thanks to the interaction knowledge propagated from each of the two compnents to the other."
A ternary Relation Algebra of directed lines,2003-07-21T16:01:11Z,Amar Isli,Amar Isli,cs.AI,"We define a ternary Relation Algebra (RA) of relative position relations on two-dimensional directed lines (d-lines for short). A d-line has two degrees of freedom (DFs): a rotational DF (RDF), and a translational DF (TDF). The representation of the RDF of a d-line will be handled by an RA of 2D orientations, CYC_t, known in the literature. A second algebra, TA_t, which will handle the TDF of a d-line, will be defined. The two algebras, CYC_t and TA_t, will constitute, respectively, the translational and the rotational components of the RA, PA_t, of relative position relations on d-lines: the PA_t atoms will consist of those pairs <t,r> of a TA_t atom and a CYC_t atom that are compatible. We present in detail the RA PA_t, with its converse table, its rotation table and its composition tables. We show that a (polynomial) constraint propagation algorithm, known in the literature, is complete for a subset of PA_t relations including almost all of the atomic relations. We will discuss the application scope of the RA, which includes incidence geometry, GIS (Geographic Information Systems), shape representation, localisation in (multi-)robot navigation, and the representation of motion prepositions in NLP (Natural Language Processing). We then compare the RA to existing ones, such as an algebra for reasoning about rectangles parallel to the axes of an (orthogonal) coordinate system, a ``spatial Odyssey'' of Allen's interval algebra, and an algebra for reasoning about 2D segments."
From Statistical Knowledge Bases to Degrees of Belief,2003-07-24T21:32:09Z,Daphne Koller,"Fahiem Bacchus, Adam Grove, Joseph Y. Halpern, Daphne Koller",cs.AI,"An intelligent agent will often be uncertain about various properties of its environment, and when acting in that environment it will frequently need to quantify its uncertainty. For example, if the agent wishes to employ the expected-utility paradigm of decision theory to guide its actions, it will need to assign degrees of belief (subjective probabilities) to various assertions. Of course, these degrees of belief should not be arbitrary, but rather should be based on the information available to the agent. This paper describes one approach for inducing degrees of belief from very rich knowledge bases, that can include information about particular individuals, statistical correlations, physical laws, and default rules. We call our approach the random-worlds method. The method is based on the principle of indifference: it treats all of the worlds the agent considers possible as being equally likely. It is able to integrate qualitative default reasoning with quantitative probabilistic reasoning by providing a language in which both types of information can be easily expressed. Our results show that a number of desiderata that arise in direct inference (reasoning from statistical information to conclusions about individuals) and default reasoning follow directly {from} the semantics of random worlds. For example, random worlds captures important patterns of reasoning such as specificity, inheritance, indifference to irrelevant information, and default assumptions of independence. Furthermore, the expressive power of the language used and the intuitive semantics of random worlds allow the method to deal with problems that are beyond the scope of many other non-deductive reasoning systems."
An Alternative to RDF-Based Languages for the Representation and   Processing of Ontologies in the Semantic Web,2003-07-29T11:13:41Z,J Gerard Wolff,J Gerard Wolff,cs.AI,"This paper describes an approach to the representation and processing of ontologies in the Semantic Web, based on the ICMAUS theory of computation and AI. This approach has strengths that complement those of languages based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) such as RDF Schema and DAML+OIL. The main benefits of the ICMAUS approach are simplicity and comprehensibility in the representation of ontologies, an ability to cope with errors and uncertainties in knowledge, and a versatile reasoning system with capabilities in the kinds of probabilistic reasoning that seem to be required in the Semantic Web."
Quantifying and Visualizing Attribute Interactions,2003-08-01T10:50:07Z,Ivan Bratko,"Aleks Jakulin, Ivan Bratko",cs.AI,"Interactions are patterns between several attributes in data that cannot be inferred from any subset of these attributes. While mutual information is a well-established approach to evaluating the interactions between two attributes, we surveyed its generalizations as to quantify interactions between several attributes. We have chosen McGill's interaction information, which has been independently rediscovered a number of times under various names in various disciplines, because of its many intuitively appealing properties. We apply interaction information to visually present the most important interactions of the data. Visualization of interactions has provided insight into the structure of data on a number of domains, identifying redundant attributes and opportunities for constructing new features, discovering unexpected regularities in data, and have helped during construction of predictive models; we illustrate the methods on numerous examples. A machine learning method that disregards interactions may get caught in two traps: myopia is caused by learning algorithms assuming independence in spite of interactions, whereas fragmentation arises from assuming an interaction in spite of independence."
Evidential Force Aggregation,2003-09-15T07:20:48Z,Johan Schubert,Johan Schubert,cs.AI,"In this paper we develop an evidential force aggregation method intended for classification of evidential intelligence into recognized force structures. We assume that the intelligence has already been partitioned into clusters and use the classification method individually in each cluster. The classification is based on a measure of fitness between template and fused intelligence that makes it possible to handle intelligence reports with multiple nonspecific and uncertain propositions. With this measure we can aggregate on a level-by-level basis, starting from general intelligence to achieve a complete force structure with recognized units on all hierarchical levels."

The Algebra of Utility Inference,2003-10-23T01:13:20Z,Ali E. Abbas,Ali E. Abbas,cs.AI,Richard Cox [1] set the axiomatic foundations of probable inference and the algebra of propositions. He showed that consistency within these axioms requires certain rules for updating belief. In this paper we use the analogy between probability and utility introduced in [2] to propose an axiomatic foundation for utility inference and the algebra of preferences. We show that consistency within these axioms requires certain rules for updating preference. We discuss a class of utility functions that stems from the axioms of utility inference and show that this class is the basic building block for any general multiattribute utility function. We use this class of utility functions together with the algebra of preferences to construct utility functions represented by logical operations on the attributes.
An information theory for preferences,2003-10-23T01:34:44Z,Ali E. Abbas,Ali E. Abbas,cs.AI,"Recent literature in the last Maximum Entropy workshop introduced an analogy between cumulative probability distributions and normalized utility functions. Based on this analogy, a utility density function can de defined as the derivative of a normalized utility function. A utility density function is non-negative and integrates to unity. These two properties form the basis of a correspondence between utility and probability. A natural application of this analogy is a maximum entropy principle to assign maximum entropy utility values. Maximum entropy utility interprets many of the common utility functions based on the preference information needed for their assignment, and helps assign utility values based on partial preference information. This paper reviews maximum entropy utility and introduces further results that stem from the duality between probability and utility."
"Abductive Logic Programs with Penalization: Semantics, Complexity and   Implementation",2003-10-24T18:03:06Z,Nicola Leone,"Simona Perri, Francesco Scarcello, Nicola Leone",cs.AI,"Abduction, first proposed in the setting of classical logics, has been studied with growing interest in the logic programming area during the last years.   In this paper we study abduction with penalization in the logic programming framework. This form of abductive reasoning, which has not been previously analyzed in logic programming, turns out to represent several relevant problems, including optimization problems, very naturally. We define a formal model for abduction with penalization over logic programs, which extends the abductive framework proposed by Kakas and Mancarella. We address knowledge representation issues, encoding a number of problems in our abductive framework. In particular, we consider some relevant problems, taken from different domains, ranging from optimization theory to diagnosis and planning; their encodings turn out to be simple and elegant in our formalism. We thoroughly analyze the computational complexity of the main problems arising in the context of abduction with penalization from logic programs. Finally, we implement a system supporting the proposed abductive framework on top of the DLV engine. To this end, we design a translation from abduction problems with penalties into logic programs with weak constraints. We prove that this approach is sound and complete."
Local-search techniques for propositional logic extended with   cardinality constraints,2003-10-31T16:29:02Z,Miroslaw Truszczynski,"Lengning Liu, Miroslaw Truszczynski",cs.AI,"We study local-search satisfiability solvers for propositional logic extended with cardinality atoms, that is, expressions that provide explicit ways to model constraints on cardinalities of sets. Adding cardinality atoms to the language of propositional logic facilitates modeling search problems and often results in concise encodings. We propose two ``native'' local-search solvers for theories in the extended language. We also describe techniques to reduce the problem to standard propositional satisfiability and allow us to use off-the-shelf SAT solvers. We study these methods experimentally. Our general finding is that native solvers designed specifically for the extended language perform better than indirect methods relying on SAT solvers."

Parametric Connectives in Disjunctive Logic Programming,2003-11-07T15:57:07Z,Nicola Leone,"Simona Perri, Nicola Leone",cs.AI,"Disjunctive Logic Programming (\DLP) is an advanced formalism for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). \DLP is very expressive in a precise mathematical sense: it allows to express every property of finite structures that is decidable in the complexity class $\SigmaP{2}$ ($\NP^{\NP}$). Importantly, the \DLP encodings are often simple and natural.   In this paper, we single out some limitations of \DLP for KRR, which cannot naturally express problems where the size of the disjunction is not known ``a priori'' (like N-Coloring), but it is part of the input. To overcome these limitations, we further enhance the knowledge modelling abilities of \DLP, by extending this language by {\em Parametric Connectives (OR and AND)}. These connectives allow us to represent compactly the disjunction/conjunction of a set of atoms having a given property. We formally define the semantics of the new language, named $DLP^{\bigvee,\bigwedge}$ and we show the usefulness of the new constructs on relevant knowledge-based problems. We address implementation issues and discuss related works."
Logic-Based Specification Languages for Intelligent Software Agents,2003-11-20T10:10:25Z,Leon Sterling,"Viviana Mascardi, Maurizio Martelli, Leon Sterling",cs.AI,"The research field of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) aims to find abstractions, languages, methodologies and toolkits for modeling, verifying, validating and prototyping complex applications conceptualized as Multiagent Systems (MASs). A very lively research sub-field studies how formal methods can be used for AOSE. This paper presents a detailed survey of six logic-based executable agent specification languages that have been chosen for their potential to be integrated in our ARPEGGIO project, an open framework for specifying and prototyping a MAS. The six languages are ConGoLog, Agent-0, the IMPACT agent programming language, DyLog, Concurrent METATEM and Ehhf. For each executable language, the logic foundations are described and an example of use is shown. A comparison of the six languages and a survey of similar approaches complete the paper, together with considerations of the advantages of using logic-based languages in MAS modeling and prototyping."
Great Expectations. Part I: On the Customizability of Generalized   Expected Utility,2003-11-20T17:36:53Z,Joseph Y. Halpern,"Francis C. Chu, Joseph Y. Halpern",cs.AI,"We propose a generalization of expected utility that we call generalized EU (GEU), where a decision maker's beliefs are represented by plausibility measures, and the decision maker's tastes are represented by general (i.e.,not necessarily real-valued) utility functions. We show that every agent, ``rational'' or not, can be modeled as a GEU maximizer. We then show that we can customize GEU by selectively imposing just the constraints we want. In particular, we show how each of Savage's postulates corresponds to constraints on GEU."

"Unsupervised Grammar Induction in a Framework of Information Compression   by Multiple Alignment, Unification and Search",2003-11-27T11:18:59Z,J Gerard Wolff,J Gerard Wolff,cs.AI,"This paper describes a novel approach to grammar induction that has been developed within a framework designed to integrate learning with other aspects of computing, AI, mathematics and logic. This framework, called ""information compression by multiple alignment, unification and search"" (ICMAUS), is founded on principles of Minimum Length Encoding pioneered by Solomonoff and others. Most of the paper describes SP70, a computer model of the ICMAUS framework that incorporates processes for unsupervised learning of grammars. An example is presented to show how the model can infer a plausible grammar from appropriate input. Limitations of the current model and how they may be overcome are briefly discussed."
Integrating existing cone-shaped and projection-based cardinal direction   relations and a TCSP-like decidable generalisation,2003-11-28T04:06:56Z,Amar Isli,Amar Isli,cs.AI,"We consider the integration of existing cone-shaped and projection-based calculi of cardinal direction relations, well-known in QSR. The more general, integrating language we consider is based on convex constraints of the qualitative form $r(x,y)$, $r$ being a cone-shaped or projection-based cardinal direction atomic relation, or of the quantitative form $(\alpha ,\beta)(x,y)$, with $\alpha ,\beta\in [0,2\pi)$ and $(\beta -\alpha)\in [0,\pi ]$: the meaning of the quantitative constraint, in particular, is that point $x$ belongs to the (convex) cone-shaped area rooted at $y$, and bounded by angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The general form of a constraint is a disjunction of the form $[r_1\vee...\vee r_{n_1}\vee (\alpha_1,\beta_1)\vee...\vee (\alpha _{n_2},\beta_{n_2})](x,y)$, with $r_i(x,y)$, $i=1... n_1$, and $(\alpha _i,\beta_i)(x,y)$, $i=1... n_2$, being convex constraints as described above: the meaning of such a general constraint is that, for some $i=1... n_1$, $r_i(x,y)$ holds, or, for some $i=1... n_2$, $(\alpha_i,\beta_i)(x,y)$ holds. A conjunction of such general constraints is a $\tcsp$-like CSP, which we will refer to as an $\scsp$ (Spatial Constraint Satisfaction Problem). An effective solution search algorithm for an $\scsp$ will be described, which uses (1) constraint propagation, based on a composition operation to be defined, as the filtering method during the search, and (2) the Simplex algorithm, guaranteeing completeness, at the leaves of the search tree. The approach is particularly suited for large-scale high-level vision, such as, e.g., satellite-like surveillance of a geographic area."
Modeling Object Oriented Constraint Programs in Z,2003-12-12T10:15:38Z,Laurent Henocque,Laurent Henocque,cs.AI,"Object oriented constraint programs (OOCPs) emerge as a leading evolution of constraint programming and artificial intelligence, first applied to a range of industrial applications called configuration problems. The rich variety of technical approaches to solving configuration problems (CLP(FD), CC(FD), DCSP, Terminological systems, constraint programs with set variables ...) is a source of difficulty. No universally accepted formal language exists for communicating about OOCPs, which makes the comparison of systems difficult. We present here a Z based specification of OOCPs which avoids the falltrap of hidden object semantics. The object system is part of the specification, and captures all of the most advanced notions from the object oriented modeling standard UML. The paper illustrates these issues and the conciseness and precision of Z by the specification of a working OOCP that solves an historical AI problem : parsing a context free grammar. Being written in Z, an OOCP specification also supports formal proofs. The whole builds the foundation of an adaptative and evolving framework for communicating about constrained object models and programs."

The definitions allow one to give a simple account of the agent's behavior in which many of the agent's tasks are reduced to computing stable models of logic programs."
Weight Constraints as Nested Expressions,2003-12-19T16:00:43Z,Vladimir Lifschitz,"Paolo Ferraris, Vladimir Lifschitz",cs.AI,"We compare two recent extensions of the answer set (stable model) semantics of logic programs. One of them, due to Lifschitz, Tang and Turner, allows the bodies and heads of rules to contain nested expressions. The other, due to Niemela and Simons, uses weight constraints. We show that there is a simple, modular translation from the language of weight constraints into the language of nested expressions that preserves the program's answer sets. Nested expressions can be eliminated from the result of this translation in favor of additional atoms. The translation makes it possible to compute answer sets for some programs with weight constraints using satisfiability solvers, and to prove the strong equivalence of programs with weight constraints using the logic of here-and there."
On the Expressibility of Stable Logic Programming,2003-12-22T18:34:21Z,Jeffrey B. Remmel,"Victor W. Marek, Jeffrey B. Remmel",cs.AI,"(We apologize for pidgin LaTeX) Schlipf \cite{sch91} proved that Stable Logic Programming (SLP) solves all $\mathit{NP}$ decision problems. We extend Schlipf's result to prove that SLP solves all search problems in the class $\mathit{NP}$. Moreover, we do this in a uniform way as defined in \cite{mt99}. Specifically, we show that there is a single $\mathrm{DATALOG}^{\neg}$ program $P_{\mathit{Trg}}$ such that given any Turing machine $M$, any polynomial $p$ with non-negative integer coefficients and any input $\sigma$ of size $n$ over a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, there is an extensional database $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma}$ such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the stable models of $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma} \cup P_{\mathit{Trg}}$ and the accepting computations of the machine $M$ that reach the final state in at most $p(n)$ steps. Moreover, $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma}$ can be computed in polynomial time from $p$, $\sigma$ and the description of $M$ and the decoding of such accepting computations from its corresponding stable model of $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma} \cup P_{\mathit{Trg}}$ can be computed in linear time. A similar statement holds for Default Logic with respect to $\Sigma_2^\mathrm{P}$-search problems\footnote{The proof of this result involves additional technical complications and will be a subject of another publication.}."

The theory also provides a basis for the design of an 'SP' computer with several potential advantages compared with traditional digital computers."
Recycling Computed Answers in Rewrite Systems for Abduction,2004-02-16T06:15:05Z,Jia-Huai You,"Fangzhen Lin, Jia-Huai You",cs.AI,"In rule-based systems, goal-oriented computations correspond naturally to the possible ways that an observation may be explained. In some applications, we need to compute explanations for a series of observations with the same domain. The question whether previously computed answers can be recycled arises. A yes answer could result in substantial savings of repeated computations. For systems based on classic logic, the answer is YES. For nonmonotonic systems however, one tends to believe that the answer should be NO, since recycling is a form of adding information. In this paper, we show that computed answers can always be recycled, in a nontrivial way, for the class of rewrite procedures that we proposed earlier for logic programs with negation. We present some experimental results on an encoding of the logistics domain."
Memory As A Monadic Control Construct In Problem-Solving,2004-02-16T17:02:29Z,Jean-Marie Chauvet,Jean-Marie Chauvet,cs.AI,"Recent advances in programming languages study and design have established a standard way of grounding computational systems representation in category theory. These formal results led to a better understanding of issues of control and side-effects in functional and imperative languages. This framework can be successfully applied to the investigation of the performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference and cognitive systems. In this paper, we delineate a categorical formalisation of memory as a control structure driving performance in inference systems. Abstracting away control mechanisms from three widely used representations of memory in cognitive systems (scripts, production rules and clusters) we explain how categorical triples capture the interaction between learning and problem-solving."
